Walter,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Junior you're my big man. There are going to be some things. Things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye."
Skyler,Happy Birthday.
Walter,Look at that.
Skyler,That is veggie bacon. Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol. You won't even taste the difference. What time do you think you'll be home?
Walter,Same time.
Skyler,"I don't want him dicking you around tonight. You get paid till 5, you work till 5, no later."
Walter,Hey.
Walter Jr,Happy birthday.
Walter,"Well, thank you."
Skyler,You're late again.
Walter Jr,There was no hot water again.
Skyler,"I have an easy fix for that. You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower."
Walter Jr,I have an idea. How about buy a new hot water heater? How's that idea? For the millionth and billionth time.
Skyler,Did you take your Echinacea?
Walter,Yeah. I think it's getting better.
Walter Jr,What the hell is this?
Walter,"It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess."
Walter Jr,Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.
Skyler,Too bad. Eat it.
Walter Jr,This smells like Band-aids.
Skyler,Eat it.
Walter Jr,"So, how's it feel to be old?"
Walter,How does it feel to be a smart ass?
Walter Jr,Good.
Walter,Eat your veggie bacon.
Walter,You all set?
Walter Jr,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Walter,"All right, see you at home."
Walter Jr,"Okay, see you."
Walter,Chemistry. It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.
Ben,Chemicals.
Walter,"Chemicals! No! Chemistry is well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change. Now just just think about this. Electrons. They change their energy levels. Molecules. Molecules change their bonds. Elements. They combine and change into compounds. Well, that's all of life. Right? I mean, it's just It's the constant. It's the cycle. It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over. It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It is fascinating, really. Chad, is there something wrong with your table? Okay. Ionic bonds Are you done? Ionic bonds. Chapter 6."
Walter,"And 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20. Here's your receipt, and hand this claiming disc to your car wash professional. Thank you. Come again."
Bogdan,He's not coming. He said he quits. I'm gonna run the register.
Walter,"Bogdan, no. We talked about this."
Bogdan,"I'm shorthanded, Walter. What am I to do? Walter? What am I to do?"
Chad,"Hey, Mr. White! Make those tires shine, huh?"
Chad’s Girlfriend,"Oh, my God. You would not believe who's cleaning Chad's car. Mr. White from Chemistry."
Everyone,Surprise!
Walter Jr,"Happy Birthday, Dad!"
Skyler,You're so very late.
Carmen,"Really, I'm serious, Skyler. I mean, you're flat as a washboard. You look awesome. She's not showing at all, is she?"
Marie,She's showing a little.
Skyler,"Carmen, this is my sister Marie."
Carmen,Pleased to meet you.
Marie,Hi.
Hank,"Glock 22. It's my daily carry, okay? I mean, unless you're talking, what, plus, P-plus loads, you can forget the 9-mil, all right? I’ve seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time."
Steve,"Yeah, the way you sh**t."
Hank,"If you're gonna bring a g*n, you gotta bring enough g*n. 40 caliber."
Walter Jr,This is awesome right here.
Hank,"Nice, isn't it?"
Walter Jr,"Dad, come check this out."
Walter,"Yeah, I see it."
Walter Jr,"Come on, take it."
Hank,"Check it out, Walt."
Walter,"No, no, it's just heavy."
Hank,"That's why they hire men. Jesus, it's not gonna bite you, all right? Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he? Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up! I'm gonna give a toast. A little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here. Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we're not gonna hold that against you. Because your heart's in the right place, man. Your heart's in the right place. We love you, man. We love you. Everybody! To Walt! Nostrovia!"
Everyone,Nostrovia!
Hank,"Oh shit, turn on Channel 3."
Hank(on the news),At which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody. I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.
Reporter(on the news),Were any shots fired?
Hank(on the news),"No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise."
Steve,"Damn, the TV does add ten pounds."
Marie,Ten pounds?
Hank,"Hey, sit and spin. Both of you."
Skyler,Hank.
Hank,What? Sorry. You didn't see that.
Skyler,So charming.
Hank(on the news),"This is clearly an ongoing operation, one which was well organized."
Walter,"Hank, how much money is that?"
Hank,"It's about 700 grand. That's a pretty good haul, huh?"
Hank(on the news),"As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade."
Walter,"Wow. But that's unusual, isn't it, that kind of cash?"
Hank,"Well, it's not the most we ever took. It's easy money until we catch you. Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along. You can watch us knock down a meth lab. Get a little excitement in your life."
Walter,"Well, someday."
Walter,Which one's this?
Skyler,That faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.
Walter,How's it doing?
Skyler,"I met my reserve, and there's still two minutes."
Walter,What's up?
Skyler,"You tell me, birthday boy. Oh, hey, so what's up for Saturday?"
Walter,Car wash. Bogdan says he needs me.
Skyler,Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?
Walter,"Probably 2, more like it."
Skyler,And then what after that?
Walter,Actually I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos. The visitor center has an exhibit on that’s really supposed to be...
Skyler,You're not gonna paint?
Walter,I'll paint. It's just that this part of this exhibition on the Mars Rover photographs are the detail really is just supposed to be amazing.
Skyler,"It's just that I really need you to paint at some point. I mean, the sooner that back bedroom gets finished. And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me standing on the stepladder."
Walter,I'll paint. I will paint.
Skyler,What is going on down there?
Walter,"No, it's just..."
Skyler,Is he asleep?
Walter,"No, It's nothing. You know, just you know, we gotta be careful about the baby."
Skyler,"Don't worry about the baby. This is just for you. We are just doing you tonight. So just close your eyes. Relax, and let it. Close your eyes."
Walter,Okay.
Skyler,There you go. That's it. That's it. There you go. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep Yes! 56!
Walter,"This is so embarrassing. I am fine. Honestly. It's just some bug going around. First my wife had it, then my son, and now me. It's just like a chest cold. Could be some low blood sugar as well. I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning, honestly. Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just drop me off at a corner somewhere?"
EMT,No. Sorry.
Walter,It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.
EMT,Take a couple of deep breaths for me. Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?
Walter,"God, no."
EMT,"Lean forward for me, would you? Mr. White, are you a smoker?"
Walter,No. Never. Why do you ask?
Doctor,Mr. White. Mr. White?
Walter,Yes.
Doctor,You understood what I've just said to you?
Walter,Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.
Doctor,I'm sorry I just need to make sure you fully understand.
Walter,"Best-case scenario, with chemo, I'll live maybe another couple years. It's just you've got mustard on your...right there. Mustard, there. Right there."
Skyler,"So my records show that I paid it, and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...All right. Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office, if they lost it or something. Yeah, let me look into that. Okay. Thank you. Did you use the MasterCard last month?"
Walter,We needed printer paper.
Skyler,"Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use."
Walter,Okay.
Skyler,So how was your day?
Walter,"Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It was, um it was fine."
Bogdan,Come on. I'm shorthanded. I need you to do some wipe-downs. Come on.
Walter,What?
Bogdan,"I said I need you outside to do some wipe-downs. Are you here to work or to be staring at the skies? Come on, let's go. Come on, man."
Walter,"f*ck you, Bogdan."
Bogdan,What?
Walter,I said f*ck you! And your eyebrows! Wipe down this!
Walter,"Uh, Hank. Hank, it's Walt. Hey. Oh, listen I didn't wake you, did I? Oh, good, good. No, no, nothing's wrong. I just, uh I've been, uh, thinking about that offer that ride-along."
Hank,"It's the last house on the right. See it? Not the two-story one. The one next to it. The kind of I don't know, what do you call that? Green?"
Steve,Sage.
Hank,"Sage. What, do you work at the f*cking Pottery Barn? Jesus."
Steve,Sage. That's the word for it. My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green?
Hank,"Cheese dick. I know that one. How 'bout that? Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?"
Walter,"So what tells you it's a meth lab?
Hank  Just our snitch. Says some dude goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there. Says he always adds a dash of chili powder. Ah, you exuberant Mexicans."
Steve,"Uh-uh. Cap’n Cook, that's a white boy's name. Dopey as hell, too."
Hank,Yeah? Tell you what. I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.
Steve,All right. You're on.
Hank,"All right, come on, come on. All right. School bus is clear. Got the green light."
Agent,Copy that.
Hank,Watch this. This makes 'em shit.
Agent,"Go, go, go."
Hank,"Meth labs are nasty on a good day. You mix that shit wrong, you got mustard gas."
Walter,Phosphine gas. I think.
Hank,"Yeah, exactly. One whiff will k*ll you. That's why the respirators."
Agent,House is clear. One suspect in custody.
Hank,"Copy that. The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?"
Agent,Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.
Steve,"Asian! Pay up, sucker."
Hank,"Hey hey hey! First name Emilio. That's at least half a beaner. Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10. Cheer up, Gomey. You people still got J. Lo."
Walter,"Hank, do you think I might get to go inside? See the actual lab?"
Hank,"Yeah. Yeah, I tell you what, we're gonna go peek our heads in, check it out first. Stay here a minute."
Jesse,God.
Walter,"Oh, my God. Pinkman?"
Walter,It's me. I'm alone.
Jesse,How'd you find me?
Walter,"You're still in our filing system. So your aunt owns this place, right?"
Jesse,I own it.
Walter,No one's looking for you.
Jesse,Why are you here?
Walter,"I was curious. Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that. There's a lot of money in it, huh?"
Jesse,I don't know what you're talking about.
Walter,No?
Jesse,Not a clue.
Walter,"Cap'n Cook? That's not you? Like I said, no one is looking for you."
Jesse,"Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White. I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in..."
Walter,Not really.
Jesse,"High school was a long time ago. You ain't Welcome Back Kotter, so step off. No speeches."
Walter,"Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name? Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square 1. But you know the business. And I know the chemistry. I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up."
Jesse,"You want to cook crystal meth? You? You and, uh and me?"
Walter,That's right. Either that or I turn you in.
Marie,What the hell is this?
Skyler,Damned if I know. I described it as mosaic folk art.
Marie,Somebody bought it?
Skyler,"Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. 14 dollars plus shipping."
Marie,"Yes! At this rate, in 50 or 60 years, you'll be rich. So how goes the novel?"
Skyler,"It's not a novel, actually, which I have..."
Marie,You're not writing a novel? You told me you were.
Skyler,No. Short stories. I said that if eventually I have enough good ones that maybe I'll try and publish another collection.
Marie,Those really didn't sell. I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
Skyler,"Yeah, well, maybe so."
Marie,"Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you."
Skyler,"No. I mean, I'm not at that stage where I...no."
Marie,Open offer. So what's up with Walt lately?
Skyler,What do you mean? He's fine.
Marie,"He just seems, I don't know, quieter than usual."
Skyler,"Turning 50 is a big deal. I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40. You're gonna be a complete basket case."
Marie,So it's a mid-life crisis.
Skyler,"No, he's just quiet."
Marie,How's the s*x?
Skyler,"Marie, Jesus."
Marie,Guess that answers that.
Walter,"You just gonna sit there? This. Look at this. Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, Very rare. You got your usual paraphernalia  Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask. But the piece de resistance  a round bottom boiling flask."
Jesse,"Well, I cook in one of those. The big one."
Walter,"One of these? No, this is a volumetric flask. You wouldn't cook in one of these."
Jesse,"Yeah, I do."
Walter,"No, you don't. A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration. You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask. That's what a boiling flask is for. Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?"
Jesse,No. You flunked me. Remember?
Walter,No wonder.
Jesse,"Prick. Now let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry, this is art. Cooking is art. And the shit I cook is the b*mb, so don't be telling me."
Walter,The shit you cook is shit. I saw your setup. Ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage. We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised. No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.
Jesse,"No, no, chili P is my signature."
Walter,Not anymore.
Jesse,"Yeah, well, we'll see about that. What the hell is this?"
Walter,"Lab safety equipment. We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station. These chemicals and their fumes are toxic, in case you didn't know that."
Jesse,"Well, you can dress up like a f*gg*t if you want. Not me. Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day."
Walter,What? I thought we were gonna cook here.
Jesse,"No, we're not gonna cook here. Okay, this is my house. I don't shit where I eat."
Walter,"Well, then, where are we gonna work?"
Jesse,"You tell me. This is your deal. You want to smoke it up, smoke it up at your house. Nah, I didn't think so."
Walter,"Oh, well. Well what if we rented one of those self-storage places, you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there?"
Jesse,No. They're on to that. They got dogs that sniff around. RV. That's what you want.
Walter,"What, like a Winnebago?"
Jesse,"Yeah. I know a dude who wants to sell his. He just goes camping with it. But a mobile meth lab? That'd be the b*mb. I mean, drive way out in the boonies. Be all evasive."
Jesse,"Dude, this isn't even 7 grand. My guy wants 85."
Walter,This is all the money I have in the world. You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.
Jesse,"You are not how I remember you from class, I mean, like, not at all."
Walter,I gotta go.
Jesse,"Wait, wait. Hold on. Tell me why you're doing this. Seriously."
Walter,Why do you do it?
Jesse,"Money, mainly."
Walter,There you go.
Jesse,"Nah, come on! Man, some straight like you, giant stick up his ass, all of a sudden at age, what, 60, he's just gonna break bad?"
Walter,I'm 50.
Jesse,"It's weird is all, okay? It doesn't compute. Listen if you've gone crazy or something I mean, if you've if you've gone crazy or depressed, I'm just saying that's something I need to know about. Okay? I mean, that affects me."
Walter,I am awake.
Jesse,What?
Walter,Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.
Skyler,How's it coming in there?
Walter Jr,Fine.
Skyler,Do you want me or your dad?
Walter Jr,Dad.
Skyler,So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight? 'Cause you don't want to get 'em if they're too tight.
Walter Jr,They're pre-shrunk.
Skyler,"Are you sure you don't want to get a different kind? Like, you know, the skinny jeans? Those are really supposed to be in style now. The skaters wear them."
Walter Jr,Do I look like a skater?
Skyler,All right.
Teenager,"Mom, look at my big-boy pants. Mommy, could you zip up my big-boy pants?"
Walter,Don't.
Skyler,What?
Walter,Don't.
Skyler,Walt.
Walter Jr,Where...
Skyler,"I have no idea. You know what? Don't even look at them. They're obviously very stupid. Yep. I think that, um I think those jeans look really good on you. You should get 'em if you like 'em, okay? Why don't you just hang out here for a second? I'll be right back."
Walter Jr,Fine.
Teenager,"Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brand-new big-boy pants. What are you doing?"
Walter,"What's wrong, chief? Having a little trouble walking?"
Teenager,"Get off me. Get off me! I'll mess you up, man."
Walter,"Well, you'll have one sh*t. You better make it good. What, are you waiting for your girlfriends? You better go. Take it. Take your sh*t. Take it! Come on. Come on."
Teenager,"Come on, let's get outta here. Let's go. Psycho."
Jesse,"Yeah, nothing but cows! Got some big cow house way out that way, like 2 miles, but I don't see nobody."
Walter,Cow house?
Jesse,"Yeah, where they live. The cows. Whatever, man. Yeah, let's cook here."
Walter,Cow house. God help me.
Jesse,What are you doing?
Walter,These are my good clothes. I can't go home smelling like a meth lab.
Jesse,"Yeah, you can. I do. Those? Those, uh You're keeping those on, right?"
Walter,Come on. Daylight's burning.
Jesse,"Oh, my God. Oh, this is, uh this is a good look for you. And you're maybe only the world's second biggest h*m*."
Walter,Would you shut up and help me?
Jesse,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, work it. Baby, work it."
Walter,Turn that off!
Jesse,"This is glass grade. I mean, you got...Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long. This is pure glass. You're a g*dd*mn artist. This is art, Mr. White."
Walter,"Actually, it's just basic chemistry, but thank you, Jesse. I'm glad it's acceptable."
Jesse,Acceptable? You're the g*dd*mn Iron Chef. Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu is going to want a taste. Now I gotta try this.
Walter,"No. No. No, we only sell it. We don't use it."
Jesse,"Okay, since when? Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice. That ain't happening."
Walter,So what now? How do we proceed?
Jesse,We cook more tomorrow. Meantime I know just the guy to talk to.
Jesse,"Kraze, how you doing, my man? You got a new dog. Right on, man. What's his name? Yeah, I had a dog like that once, except maybe, like, twice as big. Super purebred. Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nuts..."
Krazy-8,Just shut your mouth and show me your money.
Jesse,"I ain't buying, ese. I'm selling. Tell me that ain't the finest scante you ever laid eyes on. Go ahead, try it. Hey, poochie. How you doing? Jesus Christ. See? What'd I say?"
Krazy-8,It's all right.
Jesse,It's all right? It's all right?
Krazy-8,"Yeah, it's all right. So, what? You back in business?"
Jesse,"Hell, yeah, I'm back. With a vengeance. Vato loco gotta make a living. You know, with your cousin gone away and all. And listen, homes, about that. It really broke me up about Emilio. That dude is like my brother. He okay? You talk to him?"
Krazy-8,"Yeah, yeah, I talked to him. He said when the Feds came, you were out sticking it in some neighbor lady."
Jesse,"Hey, you know, I got lucky twice."
Krazy-8,"I don't know, man. Emilio, he thinks maybe you dimed on him."
Jesse,"That is bullshit. That is bullshit, Krazy-8! I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that. You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio, you tell him for me, all right?"
Krazy-8,Why don't you tell him yourself? Made bail this morning.
Emilio,"Go ahead, pendejo. Kick my ass."
Jesse,"Hey, listen..."
Krazy-8,Where did you get this? Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.
Krazy-8,"Hey, man. You some kind of nudist? That's some stone-fine tick tick you been cooking there, ese. How about you come work for me?"
Walter,I'd be willing to sell it to you if the price is right.
Krazy-8,"You out here all by yourself, huh?"
Emilio,I know you. He was there when I got busted. He's with the DEA!
Walter,No.
Emilio,You ratasnitch m*therf*cker!
Jesse,"Run, Mr. White! Run!"
Emilio,I say we cap 'em both.
Krazy-8,"Hey, you really cook up that batch?"
Walter,Yeah.
Krazy-8,You an artist. It's a damn shame.
Walter,Wait! Wait a minute. Listen to me. I'll teach you my recipe. What do you say? You want to cook like me? You let us both live and I will teach you. Put the cigarette out. Please.
Emilio,"Move it, homes. We ain't got all day."
Walter,Okay.
Jesse,What happened? What'd you do to them?
Walter,"Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture and accelerated by heat yields phosphorus hydride. Phosphine gas. One good whiff and...we gotta, we gotta clean this up."
Skyler,"Where were you? Walt. I don't know what's been going on with you lately, but..."
Walter,Nothing. I'm fine.
Skyler,"Whatever it is, I'll tell you this. I do not like it when you don't talk to me. The worst thing you can do is shut me out. Walter, is that you?"
Submitted and corrected by,Tv_Gal13
Walter,You are a lifesaver.
Jesse,"Yeah, man."
Walter,We can't thank you enough.
Jesse,"Hey, mad props."
Walter,"I could have sworn the guy said south. But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road. I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving, which is a bonehead maneuver. And all of a sudden bam, we're in that ditch."
Jesse,"Yeah, bam, I'm like, what the hell? You know?"
Walter,"Yes, and my coffee mug. Coffee? My mug of coffee? It spills all over my pants. I mean, just a nightmare."
Jesse,"Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real."
Walter,"Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful."
Jesse,Can't we just dump 'em here?
Walter,"What, then somebody finds them? Then what? People have seen us."
Jesse,"You're gonna flood it, man."
Walter,"I'm not gonna flood it. She's not gonna flood, all right? We're just gonna stay positive, right? We're going to clean up this mess. Wish you would start."
Jesse,Damn it. See? You flooded it.
Walter,All right. All right. You know what? The RV is going to start now. The RV is going to start right now. It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house.
Jesse,My house?
Walter,Yes. We'll drive it over there and park it overnight. And then tomorrow...
Jesse,"No, man, not my house!"
Walter,"Shut up! After we finish cleaning up this mess, we will go our separate ways. Our paths will never cross. And we will tell this to no one. Understood?"
Jesse,"What, I can talk now? Fine. That goes double for me."
Walter,"Be good to me. Oh, shit."
Skyler,Walt? You coming out?
Walter,"Yeah, absolutely."
Walter,"You wanna hear something funny? We had a faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior class photos, and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice. Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right? So anyway, some of the senior girls were going to that Glamour Shots place, to have their photos taken, and now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Epperman, you know Joan, suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down, because they show cleavage."
Skyler,"Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?"
Walter Junior,Yeah. I'm good.
Walter,"You know, even these small-busted girls have cleavage. Apparently there's some new type of brassiere, or something."
Walter Junior,The Wonderbra. It's the Wonderbra.
Walter(Answering Machine),"Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Junior. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message."
Jesse,"Hello, Mr. White. This is AT&T calling. Are you happy with your current long distance service? 'Cause if you're not, I would definitely, really love to talk to you as soon as possible about..."
Walter,Hello? Hello. This is Walter White speaking.
Jesse,"You said he was practically dead, okay? You said he would die any minute!"
Walter,"Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now, and I really don't appreciate these sales calls."
Jesse,"Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what. He's still not dead! I went and put my ear to the RV, I can hear him, like, rolling around in there, all right? I think he's awake, man, I think he's trying to get loose. Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here!"
Walter,"Calm down, damn it."
Jesse,Are you gonna help me clean this up? We got loose ends here!
Walter,Calm down! I will be there after school.
Jesse,"After school? Are you sh1tting me? Ditch it, man, call in sick."
Walter,"Listen, that is just not going to work for me. I'm not interested in that at all. And I would appreciate it if you don't call here anymore. Damn. They're so annoying, those people."
Skyler,"You have a good day, sweetie."
Walter Junior,"Okay, Mom. You too."
Skyler,"Bye, honey. Drive safe."
Walter,Okay.
Jesse(Answering Machine),"Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone."
Walter,"So, the term ""chiral"" derives from the Greek word ""hand. "" The concept here being that, just as your left hand, and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right? Identical, and yet opposite. Well, so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level. But although they may look the same, they don't always behave the same. For instance...I'm sorry for instance Thalidomide. The right-handed isomer of the drug, Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but, make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the left-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide, and her child will be born with horrible birth defects. Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s. So, chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right? Active, inactive. Good, bad. Yes, Ben?"
Ben,Is this gonna be on the m*rder?
Walter,What?
Ben,Is this gonna be on the mid-term?
Walter,"The chirality on the mid-term? No, no, well, maybe, maybe, yes, you know, but prepare for it to be on the mid-term. Can't hurt to know it, right? Knowledge is power!"
Jesse,"Oh, no, no not good. Not good."
Walter,"What the...hey, you. Listen No, no, no, no! Oh, God!"
Skyler,MILF's? What the hell is a MILF?
Walter,"Now what? The other one, out in the RV, he's...You're sure?"
Jesse,Yes.
Walter,Positive?
Jesse,Feel free to go check it yourself.
Walter,"Yes, good idea. Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street!"
Jesse,"Okay, you know what, I…"
Walter,"All right, all right! The one downstairs, tell me about him. Come on, anything, something! Start with his name, at least!"
Jesse,Krazy-8.
Walter,Krazy-8? What the hell does that even mean?
Jesse,"I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know."
Walter,"So, you work with him regularly?"
Jesse,"No, not him so much. His cousin, mainly."
Walter,Who's his cousin?
Jesse,The guy out in the RV!
Walter,"All right, all right."
Jesse,Krazy-8's one level higher.
Walter,One level higher?
Jesse,"Yeah, you know, not like street level. Higher. You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner? Krazy-8 is, like, the dude that sells Starbucks his beans."
Walter,"Okay, so he's a distributor. Okay, so, is he, I mean, is he in other words what is his reputation for violence?"
Jesse,"Well, um he did try to k*ll us both yesterday, so there's that."
Walter,"What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right? He's a businessman, he's a man of business. It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual self-interest, yes?"
Jesse,What?
Walter,Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?
Jesse,"What kind of reason? Like ""Dear Krazy-8, listen, ""if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family? ""No Colombian neckties. "" You mean that kind of reason? No, man, I can't say I have high f*cking hopes where that's concerned. What was that? What was what? Come see! We gotta tie him up. Why the hell didn't we tie him up?"
Walter,Because he was out cold.
Jesse,"But what if he's faking it? Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo! And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for w*apons and shit, waiting to pounce!"
Jesse,"Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough w*apon, I would just lie back down, and bide my time."
Jesse,So now what do we do?
Walter,You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.
Jesse,"Well, you gotta do something!"
Walter,"We! We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions."
Jesse,"Man, uh-uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal!"
Walter,"Don't you dare put that on me! You brought those guys out there, this is your responsibility!"
Jesse,"Like I came to you, begging to cook meth. ""Hey nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal? Please! I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV. "" What about the phosphate gas?"
Walter,Phosphine gas. What about it?
Jesse,"I mean, do you think it still might k*ll him? You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?"
Walter,I don't know.
Jesse,You're supposed to be a scientist!
Walter,"Look! This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention. We have got a body in that RV, and it's getting warmer outside, understand? And we have got to do something about that soon. And in a way that no one will ever find it. Now that last part is very, very important. Therefore, it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation. Dissolving in strong acid."
Jesse,"Oh man, that's messed up. You're not serious? You're serious? Who's gonna do that? And don't look at me!"
Walter,I guess we'll both do it together.
Jesse,"No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies."
Walter,"We're in this 50/50, okay? I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation, while the other one of us deals with the Krazy-8 situation. In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin. Heads or tails?"
Jesse,"I'll do the body in the acid, okay?"
Walter,Heads or tails?
Jesse,Heads.
Walter,Best two out of three?
Jesse(Answering Machine),"Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone."
Jesse,"Mr. White, it's me, pick up. I got a container question. Hello? Mr. White, pick up the phone, man!"
Walter,Yes?
Jesse,"What kind of plastic, man?"
Walter,Polyethylene.
Jesse,How the hell am I supposed to know that?
Walter,"Because I told you. Look, just look at the bottom for a triangle stamped ""LDPE. "" It should be molded right into the plastic."
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it. But I don't know, man, this feels kind of flimsy. Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this."
Walter,Not hydrofluoric.
Jesse,Why not?
Walter,"Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave. As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over."
Jesse,"Oh, okay. Be a dick about it. So, hey, have you done the thing?"
Walter,"Yeah, I'm working up to it."
Jesse,"You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up. Not even if you took him to the hospital right now. Now, if it was me, I would just try and think of it like I was doing him a favor."
 Krazy-8,"Who's there? Don't you f*cking play games with me. Who's there? Yeah, I see you. What are you gonna do? I need water! Bring me some water, would you? Please?"
Walter,You don't like the crust?
 Krazy-8,Where's my cousin Emilio? He dead?
Jesse,"Hey, Mr. White! Mr. White? Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God! Wait a minute. Is that my weed? What the hell, man? Make yourself at home, why don't you?"
Walter,So what did you end up buying?
Jesse,Nothing. No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
Walter,"I don't suppose you could buy two bins. Legs in one, torso in the other?"
Jesse,God. I don't suppose you could kiss my ass? How did it go? So you didn't do it?
Walter,Not yet. God. I gotta go.
Jesse,"What? No, come back here!"
Walter,"Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise."
Jesse,Tomorrow?
Walter,"I've got a doctor's appointment, I gotta go. Look, stay away from him. He's awake."
Jesse,"Hey, man, we flipped a coin. We flipped a coin!"
Skyler,We're good?
Doctor,"We're very good. We're excellent, I'd say. Oh, would you look at that face! Smile, peanut! So, who's up for knowing? Girl."
Skyler,Girl?
Walter,You sure?
Doctor,Pretty sure.
Walter,Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping?
Skyler,You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
Doctor,"Looking fabulous. Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out. I'll be right back."
Skyler,Who is Jesse Pinkman?
Walter,Jesse?
Skyler,"Jesse Pinkman. He called just this morning, Walt, please don't deny it. It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne. Was he one of your students?"
Walter,Yeah. He was nobody.
Skyler,"Who is he to you? Why is he calling? What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burn-out? You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning, you don't tell me where you've been. You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt. Tell me what's going on with you. Don't you think you owe me that? Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?"
Walter,He sells me pot.
Skyler,He sells you pot?
Walter,"Marijuana, yeah. Not a lot. I mean, I don't know. I kinda like it."
Skyler,"Are you out of your mind? What are you, like 16 years old? Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent. What is wrong with you?"
Walter,Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.
Skyler,"Yeah, no shit. Thanks for noticing."
Walter,"I haven't been myself lately, but I love you. Nothing about that has changed. Nothing ever will. So right now, what I need is for you to climb down out of my ass. Can you do that? Will you do that for me, honey? Will you, please, just once, get off my ass? You know, I'd appreciate it. I really would."
Walter,Stop! Stop in 15 minutes.
Jesse,"Just meat, is all. Just a bunch of meat. Oh, Jesus. It's cool, you're cool. You're all good, yo. You're all good in the hood. It's fine. Just a bunch of meat, come on. You got it."
Skyler,"Excuse me! Excuse me? You. Yes, you. May I talk to you?"
Jesse,This is private property!
Skyler,Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
Jesse,"No, I'm not interested."
Skyler,"Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me."
Jesse,"All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here. Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo."
Skyler,"Well, my name is Skyler White, yo. My husband is Walter White, yo. He told me everything."
Jesse,Seriously?
Skyler,"That's right. And just so you know My brother-in-law is a DEA agent. And I will not hesitate to call him. Not if I have to. Understood? This is your one and only warning. Do not sell marijuana to my husband. Okay. I mean it. Don't call our house again. You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual. You got me?"
Jesse,"I think so, yeah. No more marijuana. I can dig it."
Skyler,"You can dig it. Wonderful. Not that it's any of my business, but you might wanna consider a different line of work."
Jesse,Okay.
Jesse,"""Let's go to your house, yo!” Makes perfect sense. ""Let's completely screw up your house so you never wanna spend another night in it.” Sure. You know, why not? ""And then, how about I send over my psycho-bitch wife to you know, break your balls and threaten you?” God, that'd be hilarious. ""And then, the k*ller in the basement? The one who's completely my responsibility? Hell, let's just let him live down there. Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like three times a day.”  Sure, why not? That would be amazing. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies!"
Jesse,You got a brother in the goddamned DEA?
Walter,What?
Jesse,"You said you were just doing some ride-along. Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?"
Walter,Brother-in-law.
Jesse,Now there's a load off my mind.
Walter,Where did you hear that?
Jesse,"Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit. Yeah, that's right. She almost caught me moving Emilio! Good job in wearing the pants in the family. And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed?"
Walter,"Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting that I cooked crystal meth and k*lled a man. Is that what I think it is?"
Jesse,"Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl, so what? My house, my rules. Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay? I held up my end. I already took care of Emilio. You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up. Well, boo-hoo."
Walter,I have the truly awful job here.
Jesse,You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there? Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs. I barely got him in the bathtub!
Walter,"Bathtub? What do you mean, ""bathtub""?"
Jesse,"That's another thing. Why you got me running around town, trying to find some stupid piece of plastic, when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?"
Walter,"Oh, God. I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes. That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will however dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that."
Walter,Let's break it down. Hydrogen. What does that give us?
Gretchen,By mole? We're looking at 63%.
Walter,63? Wow that is a big bite. My next step's gotta be oxygen.
Gretchen,Oxygen  26%.
Walter,26. There you have your water.
Gretchen,Carbon  9%.
Walter,Carbon  9.
Gretchen,For a total of 98%?
Walter,Right.
Gretchen,Nitrogen  1.25%.
Walter,1.25.
Gretchen,That brings it to 99 and a quarter. Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Walter,"Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium? Calcium's not a trace. Got a whole skeleton to account for."
Gretchen,"You would think, right?"
Walter,Right.
Gretchen,Calcium. Calcium is only .25%.
Walter,"What? That low? Seriously? Damn, I never would have thought that. Okay, so where does iron fit in?"
Gretchen,"Iron. Wow, okay. .00004%."
Walter,What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Gretchen,"Apparently, it don't take much."
Walter,"No, it don't. Go figure. Sodium."
Gretchen,Sodium  .04. Phosphorus  .19.
Walter,".19. There we go. So, the whole thing adds up to 99.888042%. We are .111958% shy."
Gretchen,Supposedly that's everything.
Walter,"Yeah? I don't know. Just seems like something's missing, doesn't it? There got to be more to a human being than that."
Marie,"I hate these shoes. These shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats."
Walter Junior,Then why are you wearing them?
Marie,I like the support. My arches happen to be extremely archy.
Walter Junior,"Yo. What's up? Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes? Thanks. Bye. Gotta go take this."
Skyler,Female?
Walter Junior,"Louis. Not like it's any of your business, though."
Skyler,"Just be quick about it. Oh, and, um, please don't say yo. You can't know how much I hate that."
Marie,You missed a spot right there. Should you be up on that ladder?
Skyler,You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
Marie,I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.
Skyler,"Yeah. There's an idea. So, I'm working on this new short story, and there's this stoner character in it, and I'm trying to, well, know you, actually, let me backup. You've smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you? I mean, you at least tried it. Come on."
Marie,I perhaps tried it. Why?
Skyler,"Do you remember it having an effect on your mood, like changing it in any major way, or…"
Marie,It made me more serious.
Skyler,"Really? Because I mostly remember it made me light-headed. That's about it. I was just wondering if it maybe could you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on. Never mind."
Marie,Walter Jr. is on pot?
Skyler,What? No! No. What would make you even…
Marie,Where's he getting it from?
Skyler,Marie. Seriously.
Marie,Is it this Louis person? What are you going to do about this?
Skyler,"You need to look me in the eye. I am strictly asking about a story that I am writing, that's all. Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot. Certainly not as far as I know."
Marie,Not as far as you know?
Skyler,Marie.
Krazy-8,"Look at me. Hey, turn around and look at me. This here I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy. This is degrading."
Walter,I'm sorry.
Krazy-8,"You hope I'll make it easy on you and just drop dead, don't you? Well, I won't. So either k*ll me or let me go. You don't have it in you, Walter."
Walter,How do you know my name?
Krazy-8,Jesse. He told Emilio and me.
Walter,"When he came by to sell your meth? So what? You threaten him, huh? Did you beat it out of him?"
Krazy-8,Not even close.
Walter,What else did he tell you?
Krazy-8,"Pretty much everything you can think of. How you were his high school teacher. How one time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class. How you have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something. This shouldn't come across as some news flash. That partner of yours he's got a big mouth. Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you."
Walter,"So I should just let you go, then? Just unlock you and adios, huh?"
Krazy-8,"I don't see what real choice you have if it's between that and cold-blooded m*rder. Besides, your real problem is sitting upstairs."
Jesse,"Occupied! Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here! Just give me some privacy, would ya? What the hell, man? What are you doing, man? You assh*le!"
Walter,You told him my name.
Jesse,Says who? Him?
Walter,"My name, where I work. You told him about my son!"
Jesse,Don't touch me!
Walter,Damn junkie!
Jesse,"No, give me that!"
Walter,Too late! This is going down the toilet. Watch it go!
Jesse,"No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit."
Walter,It's worth nothing when you smoke it all. Get off the toilet. Get off the toilet! Get off the toilet! Stop it!
Jesse,No! No way!
Walter,Where the hell do you think you're going?
Jesse,"Back off, man! Jesus!"
Walter,We've got work to do!
Jesse,"No, you got work to do. I did my part."
Walter,You mean that obscenity that I spent the last two hours cleaning up? That is your contribution?
Jesse,"Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man! I didn't ask for any of this! How am I supposed to live here now, huh? My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning."
Walter,Because you didn't follow my instructions!
Jesse,"Oh, well, heil h*tler, bitch. And let me tell you something else. We flipped a coin, okay? You and me. You and me! Coin flip is sacred."
Walter,Damn it.
Jesse,"Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin. f*cking do it already."
Employee,"That's what she said. Yeah, I think we have some of those. Yeah, you'll have to try them on. Hello. 7 and 1/2, maybe. I don't know."
Marie,Excuse me. Do you have these in black?
Employee,"Anyway, so like I was saying, I went to the party the other night. Yeah, Tony was there."
Marie,"Hey, where have you been? I called you two hours ago."
Hank,"Sorry, baby. I'm kinda busy here. What's up?"
Marie,"Kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject, so I need you to focus and..."
Hank,"Hey, sit down! Sit down!"
Marie,"Damn it, Hank."
Hank,"Well, sorry, babe. I'm just kind of in the middle of something here. Sit down! Sit your ass down! Comprende? You, too! Sit down! Sientete! I'm back, baby. What's up?"
Marie,Walter Jr.
Hank,"Yeah, what about him?"
Marie,Marijuana. He's smoking it.
Hank,Bullshit.
Marie,Excuse me. His own mother seems to think so.
Hank,Skyler told you that?
Marie,She inferred it.
Hank,"She inferred it, huh?"
Marie,"She strongly inferred it, like ""Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."" Please, come on already. I want you to talk to him."
Hank,"Walt should. Skyler, better yet. She'll kick his butt up and down the block."
Marie,"I think it ought to be you. You know, tell him some horror stories. Maybe show him some autopsy pictures."
Hank,"What, autopsy for a pot overdose? Come on. I don't know, baby. It's just that, you know I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?"
Marie,"Hank, he respects you."
Hank,"Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I'll swing by their place after work."
Marie,Good. Scare him straight.
Hank,Where's my sugar?
Employee,"Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am. You need to be wearing footies before you try those on."
Marie,I'm extremely clean.
Employee,"Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it. Hey, sorry about that. Yeah, I'll check. You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones, but my manager found them, and we had to put them back on the floor."
Hank,What do you think?
Walter Junior,About what?
Hank,This look like a nice place?
Walter Junior,"No, not really."
Hank,Think you'd like to live here?
Walter Junior,No.
Hank,You sure about that?
Walter Junior,"Yeah, pretty sure. I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery."
Hank,"Well, a little detour. Figured we'd come over here and check out how the other half lives. This here's what we call the Crystal Palace. Now you know who lives in the palace? Meth-heads. Nasty, skeevy, meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit. Oh, you think that's funny? That's funny, huh? Yeah. Well, let me tell you something. Every last one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how? How do you think they got started?"
Walter Junior,I don't know.
Hank,"What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to sh**ting meth in their dicks? A gateway drug. That's what we call it. Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana. Every time. You understand?"
Walter Junior,"Um, yeah. So why are you telling me this?"
Hank,"'Cause I love you, you little b*st*rd. Hey, I was young once, you know? The world's a messed up place, you know? You know, there was this one time when...Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you, princess! Get over here! Don't make me get out of the car! Check this out. See what I'm talking about."
Wendy,"I ain't holdin', okay?"
Hank,"Did I say you could open your mouth? And hands off the car. Other side. Go around the other side. Talk to my friend here. What's your name, sweetheart?"
Wendy,Wendy.
Hank,"Wendy, huh? How much do you charge for a windy, Wendy?"
Wendy,I ain't doing him. He's a kid.
Hank,"Jesus, was that my question? Don't think so hard. It's gonna hurt your brain. Are you on the pipe or the needle?"
Wendy,Nothing. Neither.
Hank,"Show us your teeth, huh? Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites. Oh, God. See that? Pipe. Definitely. Big time. Big time on the pipe. You got something you wanna ask Wendy?"
Walter Junior,"No, not really."
Hank,"You ever smoked anything else, Wendy? Sausages don't count. Seriously. Tell my friend here how you got started. You probably used to be, what, like, a Girl Scout or probably sang in a church choir?"
Wendy,"What are you, like, handicapped?"
Hank,"He broke his leg playing football. He's a QB. Got an arm like a howitzer. So tell me, Wendy, do you smoke pot?"
Wendy,"Why, you got some?"
Hank,"All right. Hoof it. Get lost. Get out of here. Hey, fair warning! Next time I'm gonna bust you! So what do you think?"
Walter Junior,Cool.
Jesse,Shut the door. Lock it. Lock it. Who the hell was that?
Wendy,A cop and some football player messing with me.
Jesse,They ask about me? Huh?
Wendy,"No. I think they just wanted pot. Oh, shit. I left my root beer."
Skyler,Hello.
Walter,"Hey, sweetie, it's me. Listen, I'm so sorry. The time, it just completely got away from me there. My fault. My fault. Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I've I should have just you know, you're right. I gotta learn to say, you know, no! But, um Sky? You there?"
Skyler,You're at the car wash?
Walter,Yeah.
Skyler,"I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago. I called Bogdan, looking for you. Quite an earful he gave me."
Walter,"Listen, listen, I'll come home, and we'll talk about it."
Skyler,"I don't think so, Walt. Honey. Wherever you are why don't you just stay there tonight?"
Walter,Skyler? Skyler? Skyler?
Krazy-8,Walter! Kind of hungry down here! Damn. I didn't think you were coming back.
Walter,How long was I out?
Krazy-8,"10, 15 minutes. I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing. You breathe in the same thing you used on me?"
Walter,I've got lung cancer. I'll go make you another sandwich. It's safe. There's no poison.
Krazy-8,"Yeah? Because that'd be the way to do it if you're gonna do it. I suppose it would. I mean, you being a chemist and all."
Walter,"So that name Krazy-8. Do I really have to call you that? I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name?"
Krazy-8,Domingo.
Walter,"Domingo. That's Sunday, right? I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind."
Krazy-8,"Yeah, whatever. I can't say I ever liked it much."
Walter,"So, Domingo are you from around town here or someplace else?"
Krazy-8,"Walter, you getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to k*ll me. Not that I mind, you understand."
Walter,"You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me. Well, maybe. But maybe not. I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to. I mean, any good reason at all. Sell me. Tell me what it is."
Krazy-8,"I guess I'd start off by promising that, if you let me go, I won't come after you. That you'd be safe. I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened. And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it. But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that. And though in my case they happen to be true, you'd never know for sure. So what else can I tell you?"
Walter,I don't know. But you gotta convince me. And you're going nowhere until you do.
Krazy-8,"Hey, yeah. Yeah. I'm from here in town, man. ABQ. Born and bred. Never left. Studied business administration over at UNM, got my degree."
Walter,Really? Does that come in handy in the drug trade?
Krazy-8,"It doesn't hurt. I was gonna study music originally. Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee. My pops talked me out of it. Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man."
Walter,What does your dad do?
Krazy-8,He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Walter,Wait a minute. I know that place. Wait a minute. That's that...they used to have those late-night…
Krazy-8,"Those stupid commercials. Yeah, that's him. He's been doing 'em for over 30 years."
Walter,"Wait a minute. How did it go? It was, uh Wait, wait, wait. It was Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o Just sing this short refrain-o"
Both,Our furniture is bueno. Tampico is the name-o.
Krazy-8,Pretty moronic. But what can you do? It did tend to stick in your head.
Walter,"Did you write that, being the musician of the family?"
Krazy-8,"Hell, no, man. It was my crazy Uncle Alex. He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women. In his mind, it's like saying, ""I wrote Stairway to Heaven.”"
Walter,Wait a minute. Tampico Furniture. I think when my son was born we bought his bassinet there.
Krazy-8,We don't sell bassinets there. It's more of a specialty item. We used to sell cribs.
Walter,"Oh. Well, a crib, then, okay? Crib. Yeah. No, I remember that. In fact, I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials. Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life."
Krazy-8,"Yeah, no shit. Did he try selling you that extended warranty?"
Walter,"Yeah, he probably did. And I was probably dumb enough to buy it."
Krazy-8,"Yeah, that was his big thing. You ask him for a glass of water, he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice."
Walter,"So did you work there, too?"
Krazy-8,"Only my whole life, up until the day I said ""f*ck you"" and quit."
Walter,"So, uh 16 years would you have been?"
Krazy-8,"It was after school. Trust me, I was there. Might have even helped ring you up. You and your extended warranty on the crib."
Walter,Small world.
Krazy-8,"That it is. The paths we take, huh? Jesse know you got cancer?"
Walter,No one but you.
Krazy-8,Not your family?
Walter,No.
Krazy-8,Why not?
Walter,Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.
Krazy-8,"That's why you're cooking meth? You want to leave money for your family. Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go. Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you, man. Get out before it's too late."
Walter,I don't know what to do.
Krazy-8,Yeah. You do.
Walter,I'll get the key.
Walter,"No, don't do this. Don't do this. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this?"
Krazy-8,"You're doing the right thing, Walter."
Walter,So you're not angry?
Krazy-8,"How do you mean? Angry? No. Live and let live, man."
Walter,That's very understanding.
Krazy-8,"Whatever, man. I just want to go home."
Walter,"Me, too."
Krazy-8,"Unlock me, Walter."
Walter,The moment I do are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Jesse,Hello? Anybody down here?
Carmen,"Everybody! I need you all to take your seats. Settle down, please. Thank you. I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning, so you folks are going to have to be making do with me today. And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon. Very important stuff."
Steve,So what do you think?
Hank,It's a cook site. Gotta be. Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy. Fire there could have started by accident. Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence. Got a couple of Dually tracks headed away towards the road.
Steve,"So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab. They accidentally start a fire, and everybody F.O.'s?"
Hank,"Yeah, why not? Except why would that little hair-gelled shit leave his car? I-yi-yi, Gomie! It's a culture in decline."
Steve,It's a rich and vibrant culture.
Hank,"It's a car that jumps up and down. What the hell? You people used to be conquistadors, for Christ's sake. Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here."
Steve,"I already searched it. You're wasting your time. Give it up. If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it."
Hank,"You are talking to the trap car master, my friend. I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks."
Steve,"Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded."
Hank,"Yeah, baby. Hello, Zippy."
Steve,assh*le.
Hank,"I'd say that looks like meth, but it's too damn white. You know what I'm thinking, Gomie."
Steve,Somebody croaked our snitch.
Cop,"Hey, agents!"
Hank,You got something?
Walter,I don't know. Just doesn't it seem like something's missing?
Gretchen,What about the soul?
Walter,The soul. There's nothing but chemistry here.
Walter,Skyler. There's something I have to tell you.
Hank,"Operation Icebreaker. How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?"
Steve,Isn't it the name of a breath mint?
Hank,What?
Steve,"""Icebreakers,”  right? Breath mint?"
Hank,"Nobody's gonna be thinking that. They'll think about a big ass ship in the North Pole, breaking ice."
Steve,"Says you. I'm gonna be thinking ""Operation Breath Mint."""
Hank,"I'm thinking ""Operation Breath Mint"" every time we're on a stakeout together. Your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon. All right. ""Operation TBD."" Thanks for nothing, Gomie. Anyway. Say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina, AKA ""Krazy-8."" Smarter than your average cheese-eater. I turned him out at the street-level, but this dude's like the Jeffersons  Movin' on up. Every small-time dealer he'd throw at us, he'd end up snaking their customers. It turns out he's missing, presumed dead. Found his car out in the boonies. Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin, Emilio Koyama."
Agent,You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?
Hank,"Could be. Turns out he's missing, too. Normally, I'd say someone did the world a favor. But our snitch's car? Turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab. They come back, they tell us it is the purest they have ever seen. Our chemist was blown away. He said he couldn't do the same thing better. Worse yet, it didn't come out of some superlab in Mexico. We're thinking this was cooked right here, in the Land of Enchantment. Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site. This is the only other thing left behind. We're sending it off to Quantico, see if they can pull something off it. Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element and found the same 99.1% meth. So be on notice. We got new players in town. We don't know who they are, where they come from but they possess an extremely high skill-set. Me personally? I'm thinking Albuquerque just might have a new kingpin."
Hank,"Jesus. Walt, you're burning the shit out of them. Damn it. Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken? Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack. All right, looking good."
Marie,Is this low-fat mayonnaise in the cole slaw?
Skyler,I don't know. It's store-bought.
Walter,"Hank, you need another beer?"
Hank,Does the Pope shit in his hat?
Marie,"I don't think that he does, Hank. And I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that."
Marie,"I'm all right, thanks."
Walter Jr,"Hey, I want a beer."
Hank,"Yeah. I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggie. Guess what? That ain't happening, either."
Walter,How about some more soda?
Walter Jr,"Yeah, sure."
Walter,"Honey, do you need anything?"
Skyler,"No, Walt. Thank you."
Walter,Okay. I'll be right back.
Hank,"What, are you kidding me? You look like a damn movie star, man. Girls gotta be lining up left and right. Tell him how good-looking he is."
Skyler,He's adorable.
Hank,"He don't wanna be friggin' adorable. He wants to be hot. You see what I'm talking about? That's a female perspective. She supposed to say that. Look, a guy doesn't have to look like, uh Charlton Heston I'm talking ""Moses"" days to get a girl, all right? You just gotta have confidence. Confidence and persistence. That's what I'm talking about. I chased your Aunt Marie here all over creation. I kept bugging her for a date. She kept saying no. What, did I ask you like 50 times?"
Marie,It was before they tightened the stalking laws.
Hank,"Anyway, how about your dad here? Right there's a good story, Walt. Tell him how you met Skyler."
Walter Jr,Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos. And Dad said that thing to you…
Walter,"Actually, your mother wasn't a waitress. It was a summer job, and she was the hostess, and she also worked the cash register. And I used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where I could ride my bicycle. And once I noticed her it got to be so that I would only go in when I knew she was working. When it was slow, she would lean against the counter, doing her crossword puzzles, but kind of hiding it, right, pretending that she was still working. And once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich. It got so that everyday at lunch, we would both be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle ten feet from each other. Eventually, I caught her looking over at me. So, I began saying, ""Excuse me. ""Fourteen across, seven-letter word for whatchamacallit. ""May I ask what you wrote down?"" That got us talking. Boy, I tell you, I was terrible at those puzzles. I don't think that I finished even one of them. But your mother would do them in ink."
Hank,"Very smooth. I'll bet you didn't think your old man had it in him? But that's what I'm talking about. That's persistence. You see? Once you set your cap for something, or somebody, you gotta just, you know Skyler?"
Walter Jr,"Mom, are you all right?"
Marie,"Shh, honey. It's okay. What's the matter? What is it?"
Skyler,Ask him.
Marie,What's she talking about? Walt.
Walter,I have cancer. Lung cancer. It's bad.
Skyler,Ask him how long he's known.
Walter,"I guess a month, maybe, or..."
Marie,"For God sakes, Walt. We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on?"
Skyler,"He made me promise not to tell anybody. Christ, these last 48 hours. And it's the weekend, so I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone."
Hank,"Buddy, why I mean, why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?"
Skyler,Don't you see? Everybody just wants to help you. We're family. We get through these things together.
Hank,"I mean, I don't get, you know, lung cancer? How could that happen? You don't smoke."
Skyler,I'm thinking that this goes back to the applications lab. All those chemicals they had you working around?
Walter,We always took the proper precautions.
Skyler,"One time you complained they didn't give you the right kind of I don't know, some kind of ventilation hood or something. And then the headaches."
Walter,"Honey, it wasn't that."
Skyler,How do they think they can get away with this? We should hire a lawyer.
Marie,"First, let's deal with this. Okay? So what's the next step for Walt? Certainly a second opinion, right?"
Skyler,Right. Right. Absolutely.
Marie,"Okay. So first thing tomorrow, I talk to my radiologists, we find you the best oncology dream team."
Skyler,"I wanna go check on Walt Jr. I'm gonna see if I can talk him into, I don't know, joining us. I really didn't mean for him to find out that way."
Hank,"Whatever happens I hope this goes without saying, but whatever happens I want you to know that I'll always take care of your family."
Jesse,"Yo, check out these fake Pop Tarts. These are mad tight."
Skinny Pete,"No, thanks, man. Pass."
Jesse,Your loss. These are from Canada or something. Imported.
Combo,"Yo, what happened to your hallway, man? Did the ceiling fall down or…"
Jesse,"Oh, yeah I think the house is just settling. It's been caving in left and right. Hit me in the eye. It's bananas."
Skinny Pete,"Yo, my pops could fix you up. He's like a contractor or something."
Jesse,Right on. I should grab that number.
Combo,"Say, Jesse. You still cook a little crystal?"
Jesse,"Could be, yeah. You know, from time to time."
Skinny Pete,I heard you lost your partner. Emilio. Didn't he get locked up?
Combo,"No, man. He's out. His cousin bailed him out. He skipped town or something."
Jesse,I don't know about any of that. I've been kinda doing my own thing these days.
Combo,"But you maybe got some crystal, man? 'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl. You know? Take the edge off."
Skinny Pete,"Hell, yeah. Sunday night bowl, yo."
Jesse,"Maybe it just so happens that I just recently cooked the best batch ever. Oh, yeah. Came up with this whole new recipe. It's more like a formula. It's like way, way more chemically, you know, it's just the b*mb. But, you know, I don't know, I've been thinking lately I'll just lay off of it for a while. 'Cause lately it's been making me paranoid, so, you know, for, like health wise, just lay off."
Combo,"Yo, if you're not into sharing, man, just tell us to piss off. It's cool. We don't need no soap opera."
Skinny Pete,"Yeah, man. Whatever."
Jesse,"No, no. It's all good. You know, I'm just saying. Hey, I got plenty of pot."
Combo,"Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man."
Skinny Pete,"Yeah, sounds about right."
Jesse,"Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes. I'm joking. Okay, I'm totally joking with you. You kidding? Sit down. Best scante ever. Grab that pipe."
Skyler,Do you need some help?
Walter,"No, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. Just Privacy. Thanks."
Skyler,I'm right outside if you need me.
Skyler,"Yeah, anytime on Friday is absolutely fine. Thank you so much for working us in. Can I just put that on a credit card? Great. Perfect. Okay, so we will see you at 10 45 on Friday morning. Thank you so much. Honey. The best oncologist I mean, not even just in New Mexico, but one of the top ten in the entire nation. His name is Dr. Delcavoli. And we see him on Friday. I mean, Marie really came through for us. She had her boss call and this is good. From here on out, things are gonna..."
Walter,What's that we're putting on a credit card?
Skyler,It's just a deposit kind of thing.
Walter,How much of a deposit?
Skyler,"It's $5,000."
Walter,Five thousand? And what's that? Just to start? Just to tell me what I already know?
Skyler,"Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay? So be it. We'll figure it out. Come on. Don't get hung up on money here. We can always borrow from Hank."
Walter,"Absolutely not. No, I just, we're not gonna do that."
Skyler,"Well, maybe we can ask your mom. Have you even called her yet? Regardless, you're gonna have to tell her. I'm willing to do it."
Walter,I'll call.
Skyler,I don't want us thinking about money. Money is not the issue here. It's not.
Walter,I'll take care of the deposit. I'll borrow it from my pension.
Walter,"What's up? I thought I heard mice. That's all we need, huh? So, what's up, pal?"
Walter Jr,What the hell's wrong with you?
Walter,What?
Walter Jr,"You're acting all, why are you acting so weird? You're acting like nothing is going on."
Ken,"Come on! Am I gonna have to come down there and whip your ass? And let me tell you something else. I'm not doing this for charity, right? I'm the best he's got in that office. He knows it, I know it. I expect to be paid to a level comens I said, ""Dave, do you think That's less than 10% of what I booked for you guys this quarter. I'm not going to sit here and be disrespected. Oh, he's shitin bricks. Oh, you know he is. Yeah, that man lives in fear. I'll go across town. Hell, I could go anywhere. Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher, even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me a partner just for walking in the damn door. That's how ecstatic they'd be. Hells, yes, brother-man! Check this chick out. Who? Buddy, she's a cow. Stacey's a cow. We're talking major barnyard boo-hog. Roll her in flour and look for the wet spot before you hit that, man. You know?"
Teller,Sir? Sir?
Walter,Sorry. Hi.
Teller,What can I do for you?
Ken,Which dude? The dude that looked like a lizard?
Walter,"I'm sorry. I would like a cashier's check in the full amount made out to Oncology Partners of New Mexico, please. Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y. Yeah, you got it."
Mr. Pinkman,I don't understand why they're forcing you to choose between the piccolo and the oboe. You show so much promise with both.
Jake,"They can't have any switching between woodwinds because no matter how divided up, someone would be left out."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Well, rules are rules, I guess."
Mr. Pinkman,"Sure, rules and rules. I'm all for that. But I'm telling you, you really shine on that oboe. You have real talent, and I'm not just saying that."
Jake,Thanks.
Mrs. Pinkman,What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he giving you enough individual attention?
Jake,I'd have to say so. He tries to talk to each one of us at least once during every practice.
Mr. Pinkman,"That's good. Feedback is important. It's key, I think. Hey, so how was soccer practice?"
Mrs. Pinkman,I think that was in our backyard.
Mr. Pinkman,Who's there? What the hell are you doing out here?
Jesse,"Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom. Jake. You got new patio furniture. Right on! My leg."
Mrs. Pinkman,What do you think it could be?
Mr. Pinkman,"God knows I'm no expert. I don't know. Uppers, downers? Your guess is as good as mine."
Mrs. Pinkman,"I think we should check his arms for needle marks. Do we let him stay? The Presbyterian Church has those meetings. So maybe on condition, you know? If he agrees to attend? I just don't know what to tell Jake."
Jesse,Good evening.
Mrs. Pinkman,Sleep well?
Jesse,"What time's, uh what time is dinner?"
Mrs. Pinkman,"In about an hour. You know, I could wash those clothes if you'd like. They look a little lived in."
Jesse,"No, that's cool. Maybe later."
Mr. Pinkman,We are not doing this again.
Mrs. Pinkman,Adam.
Mr. Pinkman,"No. We said we'd lay down the law, we lay down the law. We just have to be consistent about it."
Walter,"You're not taking the bus? All right, well, listen. Give me maybe another 20 minutes and we'll get out of here."
Walter Jr,All right.
Walter,"Yeah, good. You know, I just think that things have a way of working themselves out."
Jesse,When did you get this?
Jake,"Last May at the year-end assembly. They gave me that one, too. The one on the end."
Jesse,"Environmental Consciousness Award. What's that mean? You, like, recycle cans and shit?"
Jake,I contacted the Albuquerque Journal and asked what chemicals they use to bleach their paper. They wound up writing an article about it.
Jesse,"Right on, little bro! Making mad in-roads with the business community. All right! Now, hey, remember, not all learning comes out of books. Look at you. We should hang out more often. You know, just kick back and chill. I mean, if you ever, like, I don't know, need advice. Because, yo, I mean, I've been through it all. For real. Hey, man, you play the flute?"
Jake,"It's a piccolo, actually."
Jesse,"Dude, play some, play some Jethro Tull."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Hey, guys. How are we doing in here?"
Jesse,We're good.
Jake,"Yeah. Fine, Mom."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Well, that's good. That's great."
Jesse,"What the hell? You see this? What, am I some criminal or something?"
Jake,Whatever.
Jesse,"Whatever? What, you think that's okay? Like, ""Oh, we can't let that scumbag warp the mind of our favorite son."""
Jake,"I'm the favorite? Yeah, right. You're practically all they ever talk about."
Jesse,"Oh, snap. Awesome."
Combo,"Yo, man, it's me. Hey, listen. You know, that product? You got any more of that?"
Jesse,"Nah, man, okay? I'm done giving out freebies. You want charity, go ask the Salvation Army."
Combo,"No, no charity. I got this cousin, he's got him some rich friends. These dudes are in town. They're looking to part-tay. And your stuff is, like, so sweet. So what do you say? You up for making some fat stacks? Because they'll buy everything you got."
Walter,You can't be serious. What the hell are you doing here?
Jesse,"Yo, I waited till the ball buster left. I mean, no offense."
Walter,Who sent you? You wearing a wire? You setting me up?
Jesse,"A wire? You want a wire? I got a wire. Speak into the mic, bitch! What the hell's wrong with you? A wire. Jesus."
Walter,So who did you tell about...
Jesse,"Nobody. What are you, nuts?"
Walter,Then why are you here?
Jesse,"I don't know. To, like touch base."
Walter,Touch base?
Jesse,"Yeah, you know what you call a debrief? Maybe we could, like I thought we could debrief."
Walter,"Debrief? Wow, that's what you think we need, to debrief?"
Jesse,"Yeah, after what happened, it just seems like the thing to do. Kind of, you know, talk about it. We can't talk to anybody else. Anyway, that, and I wanted to tell you how much everybody digs that meth we cooked. Everybody digs the meth we cooked. Seriously, I got dudes that would give their left nut for a little more."
Walter,Great.
Jesse,"I'm just saying, if you ever saw your way clear to you know, you and I cooking a little more."
Walter,Get the hell off my property.
Jesse,What? I'm just saying.
Walter,Go and don't come back. Now!
Jesse,"All right. You know what? Four grand. Your share from selling that batch. That's why I'm here. Yeah, that's right. I didn't smoke it all."
Dr. Delcavoli,"Non-small cell adenocarcinoma. Stage 3a, which means it's spread from the lung to the lymph nodes. There's no denying it's very serious."
Skyler,But is it curable?
Dr. Delcavoli,"I prefer the word ""treatable."" But the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective. Without making any promises, I can tell you that the specific course of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest has been successful. In certain cases, it prolonged patients' lives and even resulted in remission."
Walter,What about the side effects?
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, they can be mild to practically non-existent, or they can be pretty darn awful. It varies from patient to patient. Typically, there's hair loss, which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy. You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy. You won't want to get out of bed. You may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues. Muscle aches and pains, gums get sore and bleed. And, of course, there's the possibility of nausea. Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic and try to counteract that. Possible kidney or bladder irritation. You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding. There may be sexual side effects. Your skin may become dry and irritated."
Mr. Pinkman,Got anything to say? What do you know about that?
Jesse,Nothing.
Mr. Pinkman,That's not going to fly this time.
Mrs. Pinkman,"How many chances have we given you? How many times have we sat right here and had the same conversation over and over again where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance, and you play on our emotions, and you tell us anything you think we want to hear just so we'll give you another chance? And it makes us feel like fools, every time. Enough, Jesse. Enough."
Mr. Pinkman,We are not going to have this in our house. We need you to leave.
Jake,Thanks for not telling on me. You think I could have it back?
Jesse,It's skunk weed anyway.
Skyler,"You know, this is actually very hopeful. Did you hear me? I said this is really very, very hopeful. Can I call them and tell them you'll start next week?"
Walter,"I just think that we need to discuss it a little more, that's all."
Skyler,What is there to discuss? You're going to get the best treatment and he's the best.
Walter,"Well, there's the money discussion. $90,000 out of pocket. Maybe more."
Skyler,"There's a way, Walt. There's financing, there's installment plans. I could always go back to work. Walt, there's always a way."
Walter,"All right. Skyler, say that there is a way. And we spend all that money, and... Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt? I just don't want emotions ruling us. Maybe treatment isn't the way to go."
Walter Jr,Then why don't you just f*cking die already? Just give up and die.
Ken,"Come on, move your ass. What do I care? Yeah, I'm not worried. I have the best f*cking attorney. I would not want to be on the other side of this one. What the hell? What are you doing? Call somebody, call the fire people. I don't believe it. You know how much I paid for that? Why is it doing this?"
Jesse,"Here's my resume. I mean, technically it says ""curriculum vitae,"" which I think is more professional, but, you know, the same thing pretty much."
Manager,Great. But this position truly is a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.
Jesse,"Well, and it doesn't really say it here, but I have a solid background in sales. I'm pretty much a self-starter, so."
Manager,"That's excellent, but…"
Jesse,"I really feel I could be a major, major asset to your sales force."
Manager,"I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding. This isn't actually a sales job. I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position, but our agents need to be licensed, have at least two years on-the-job experience, and usually a college degree. What you would be doing is more like advertising."
Badger,"Hey, Jesse! Hey, man! Yo, man! What up?"
Jesse,Badger?
Badger,Where you been keeping yourself? Nice duds.
Jesse,"Yeah. You, too."
Badger,Thanks.
Jesse,"Yo, why would you want to do this lame ass job anyway? I mean, no offense."
Badger,"Because I'm on probation, yo. Gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated. Upstanding citizen. All that shit. It's really good exercise, too. Look. You can't just stand there. You have to spin the arrow. There's all these moves you have to learn, like the helicopter. See? That one's a bitch. I'm not very good at it yet."
Jesse,"No, you really opened my eyes to the possibilities. Hey, anyways, thanks for the toke."
Badger,"Anytime. Speaking of which, you think you could maybe hook me up with some crystal?"
Jesse,"Nah, I've been out of the business for a while actually now. Thinking about retiring."
Badger,What? No! That stuff you made is unbelievable.
Jesse,It was pretty awesome.
Badger,Retirement? I can't be hearing this!
Jesse,"I had this partner who was helping me cook. I mean, I was doing most of the work, but he was an assh*le, so. Anyway, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by."
Badger,"I can hook you up with some pseudo. Major pseudo. I got channels, bro. We could partner up. No pressure. No pressure. Just think about it, all right? I gotta go. Yo, this way to savings! Save your dollars bills, yo!"
Walter,It's a stupid gift.
Skyler,"No, it isn't. He'll love it."
Walter,"I don't know what I was thinking. Didn't the invitation even say ""no gifts""?"
Skyler,Walt.
Walter,What?
Skyler,We have to go.
Walter,I know. I'm not complaining.
Skyler,"Yes, you are. Look, we need this. We've been through a lot lately, okay?"
Skyler,Guess we didn't get the beige memo.
Walter,We're okay.
Skyler,"Yes, I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985."
Walter,"Honey, you look fine."
Skyler,"Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me."
Walter,"Would you look at that? The invitation said ""no gifts."""
Skyler,"Oh, come on."
Employee,"Sir, I'll take that for you."
Walter,Thank you.
Employee,You're welcome.
Skyler,"Oh, look, there's Elliott. Let's go say hello."
Walter,Elliott.
Elliott,Walt! You made it.
Walter,Happy birthday. Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Elliott,"Thank you. Skyler. Oh, that's right. Great to see you. You look beautiful as always."
Skyler,"Well, these days are a little more big than beautiful, but."
Elliott,"Of course! Congratulations. That was such great news. Thank you. Gretchen, look who's here!"
Gretchen,"It's been ages. It's so good to see you. It's really good. Skyler, welcome. Congratulations."
Skyler,Thank you. It's really nice to be here.
Gretchen,When are you due?
Skyler,"We're looking at about ten more weeks. Actually, we recently found out that it's a girl."
Gretchen,Congratulations. That's so wonderful. We've been thinking about it for ourselves.
Elliott,"Yeah, thinking about it."
Walter,"By the way, securing that patent was just amazing. I mean, the work that your company is doing, congratulations, to both of you."
Elliott,"Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot of luck. Oh, well, no. Will you excuse us? We gotta say hi. Make yourselves at home. We'll catch up later."
Walter,Sure. Okay.
Elliott,So good you're here. Thank you.
Skyler,Shall we?
Farley,Walt? I thought that was you.
Walter,Farley! Long time no see.
Farley,"This Walter White. Back at CalTech, you were just the master of crystallography. I remember this one time, we were stuck on this protein problem for weeks! You just breezed right in and you had one word for us, too. It was synchrotrons, yeah. They generate purer and more complete patterns than x-ray beams. Data collection takes a fraction of the time. This is the White in Gray Matter. Tell 'em, Walt."
Walter,"Okay. Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name. Schwartz  black. Walter White. So, together they became Gray Matter Technologies."
Farley,"Cute, huh?"
Friend,So you run the company with Elliott?
Farley,"Well, no. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott."
Walter,I gravitated toward education.
Friend,What university?
Elliott,It's a Stratocaster!
Friend #2,Not just any Strat. That's one of Clapton's.
Elliott,"No way. ""To Elliott. ""Sorry about the buckle rash. Eric Clapton."" Thank you. This is beautiful."
Skyler,"Why is he doing this? What is he, like eight years old?"
Gretchen,"Here, honey."
Elliott,"Thanks. Oh, this is from Walt."
Walter,God.
Skyler,It's okay.
Elliott,"Yum-Good Ramen. This is what Walt and I lived on for while we were working on our thesis. They sold them down at Ralsto's in the hardware aisle, right next to the what was it?"
Walter,Sterno.
Elliott,"The Sterno. Yeah, 10 for $1.99. To this day, I am convinced these noodles were responsible for our success. This was our lifeblood. Where'd you find these? I thought they'd been outlawed years ago. I love it. Thank you, Walt. For the man who has everything."
Elliott,"No, no. It was. You remember the fat guy, the fat guy. We used to call him ""Snot Trough"" because he had that thing under his...what do you call that thing?"
Walter,That was Dobkins! That was the same guy who always smelled like chocolate milk. It was!
Elliott,"No, no, no, no. It wasn't Dobkins. Anyway, I swear to Christ he used to iron those patches onto the elbows of his Members Only jacket because he thought it made him look more distinguished. Didn't it? No. Well, here's to Snot Trough."
Walter,"To Snot Trough. Wherever you may be. God bless him. And you remember the professor who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen? Yes. All you had to do was mention the Bunsen burner and he was off on a rant. ""No, he didn't invent it."" You remember the waving? ""He just improved it!"" You know. It was easy to k*ll."
Elliott,"Oh God, I miss this, Walt."
Walter,"Yeah. Me, too."
Elliott,"Listen, we ought to get together more often."
Walter,Skyler and I would love to have you and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.
Elliott,"Sure, yeah, absolutely. But what I mean is that you and I should work together again."
Walter,Are you going to teach high school?
Elliott,"No, no. Seriously. What's stopping us?"
Walter,"Wait a minute. Elliott, what are you? Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter?"
Elliott,"Yeah. Why not? You'd fit right in. You're brilliant, you've got a ton of experience."
Walter,"Well, I wouldn't really know where to begin. I mean God. You have no idea. I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table."
Elliott,"Look, I understand. You're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here. We could really benefit from a new set of eyes. You know what it is when you've been trying to crack some problem for months on end. You get tunnel vision. One guy thinking outside of the box, you may be exactly what we need."
Walter,"Well, listen, Elliott, your offer is very appealing. It really is. I thank you. But there's something you should know. I have some personal issues."
Elliott,"Look, there's nothing we can't work out."
Walter,"Well, yeah, but it's complicated."
Elliott,We can help you. We have excellent health insurance. The best.
Skyler,"Hey, did you try those prosciutto wrapped figs? They were, like, wow! They were just I must have had about 30 of those suckers. And the seafood table. Did you see that? They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, there was, like, shrimp. Walt?"
Walter,"What the hell did you say to Elliott? You told him about the cancer, didn't you? Didn't you? I can't believe it."
Skyler,"Okay, we were talking. He asked how you were doing, and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned. He knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me."
Walter,He pressed you. Come on.
Skyler,"Walt! When it came right down to it, I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth."
Walter,"The truth? How about you just said ""he's fine,"" huh? Maybe you could've just have said that? ""He's fine,"" and done."
Skyler,I don't like the way you're talking to me.
Walter,I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs to people who are not even in our lives anymore.
Skyler,What exactly did he say to you?
Walter,He offered me a job.
Skyler,What?
Walter,"Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf, you know? Some face-saving bullshit that allowed me to generously accept his charity. And then, when I turned that down, he flat-out offered to pay for my treatment. Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you? Didn't you?"
Skyler,"No. Please. Come on. I did not put him up...Okay, what did you say? Walt?"
Walter,What do you think I said?
Skyler,Why? Walt.
Walter,You ready to go?
Walter Jr,I'm taking the bus.
Skyler,"Okay bye, honey."
Badger,"Hey, dude, are these b*llet holes?"
Jesse,"No, man. Those are for, like, you know, ventilation."
Badger,"Cool. Nice set-up, huh?"
Jesse,"Man. This is nothing, man. I used to have, like, twice as much glassware until my dumbass ex-partner drove us into a ditch and wrecked most of it."
Badger,"Big ass beaker, huh?"
Jesse,"Wait, wait. No, that's a, yeah, that's a boiling flask. This is a beaker. Here's a Griffin beaker, here's a volumetric beaker. Here's an Erlenmeyer flask. You got…"
Badger,You really know your shit.
Jesse,"Well, it's just basic chemistry, yo. So you got something for me?"
Badger,"Oh, hells, yeah!"
Jesse,"Okay. We're in business. Right on, Badger."
Badger,"Dude, check this out."
Jesse,"Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for?"
Badger,Hunting. We might see javelinas.
Jesse,Are you going to help me or what? Badger!
Teenager,"Let me see the money. Nah, I need five each. Come on, two more. Here."
Walter Jr,What about him?
Teenager,Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.
Walter Jr,Whatever.
Teenager #2,What about that guy?
Walter Jr,"Nah, he looks like a businessman."
Teenager,So what?
Walter Jr,"So, businessmen are always in a hurry. They're always, like, going to some meeting or something. Seriously, he's just going to say no."
Teenager,This guy. This is our guy. You're up.
Walter Jr,Why do I have to do it?
Teenager,Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
Walter Jr,"Excuse me, hey. We forgot our IDs and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a six-pack."
Cop,"You know, what you're asking is illegal."
Walter Jr,"No, it's not?"
Cop,"Yeah, it is."
Cop,Guess you win the jackpot. This is not how I wanted to spend my night off. Consider this your first and last warning.
Walter Jr,"Yes, sir."
Cop,You're lucky you got a good dad here.
Walter Jr,"If the other guys hadn't run, I could've talked my way out of it."
Hank,"Not cool, man. Not cool."
Walter Jr,"What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?"
Hank,"No, I'm talking about you calling me and not your father. How do you think that will make him feel?"
Skyler,I don't even know what to say to you. Just go. I'll deal with you later.
Hank,Where's Walt?
Skyler,I haven't seen him since this morning. Your guess is as good as mine.
Hank,"Listen, do me a favor, all right? Don't tell him about the kid. Just a teenager trying to score some beer, you know? You know. Just growing pains. I mean, he finds out his dad's sick, he starts acting out, you know? First the pot, and then this."
Skyler,The pot?
Hank,You told me he was smoking reefer.
Marie,"That's what Skyler told me. I mean, you may as well have."
Skyler,"I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr. I was talking about Walt."
Marie,Excuse me?
Skyler,He admitted it. He said he liked it.
Hank,Walt? I didn't think he had it in him.
Skyler,"It's like he's not himself lately. I mean, why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment? Especially when it's completely paid for? Why is he doing this? You know what we need to do? What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us, and get everything out on the table. Talk it all through."
Marie,You mean an intervention?
Skyler,"No, no. Just a family meeting where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard."
Badger,"You are a genius, bro! This cankenstein is unreal! When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit 'cause we're gonna make some mad dough!"
Jesse,It's not right.
Badger,What do you mean it's not right?
Jesse,"It's cloudy. It's not supposed to be cloudy. That last time, it was glass."
Badger,"So what? Cloudy, not cloudy, it looks good enough to me."
Jesse,"""Good enough."""
Badger,"Yo, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind? I totally would've smoked that!"
Jesse,"It's not for you, it's for our customers. They're gonna demand a certain standard."
Badger,What? What are you? What?
Jesse,We'll just do it again until we get it right.
Skyler,"Walt, please have a seat and join us."
Jesse,We can do better.
Badger,Don't you f*cking think about it! Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted! You know how long I had to spin that stupid sign?
Jesse,"Get off me, psycho!"
Badger,"Helicopter, bitch! Open the door! Come back here, you bitch! I'm gonna mess you up!"
Skyler,"I really need to understand your thought process because clearly I don't. I feel that this decision you've made is not only not in your best interest, it's not in the best interest of our entire family."
Walter,"Look, Skyler."
Skyler,"Not yet. Please. I have the Talking Pillow. Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember? And then, you'll get your chance. Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that. But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in, I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help. Maybe it's the way you were raised. But, honey it's okay to lean on people now and again. You need this treatment, and nothing can stop you from getting it, except you."
Walter,Am I allowed to respond?
Skyler,"In a minute. I think we need to go around the circle first. Hank, would you like to start?"
Hank,"Yeah. Okay. Well, what I'll say is…"
Skyler,"No, take the Talking Pillow."
Hank,"All right, look, buddy. I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but I care about you a hell of a lot. This cancer thing, let's just face it. You know, you were dealt a shit hand. But sometimes your luck can change. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know, I started with a shit hand and I ended up with a full house. Okay? I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there. Man, you gotta keep placing your bets. Keep placing your bets."
Marie,"Hank, what the hell are you saying?"
Skyler,"Please, Marie, let him talk. That's what we're here to do. Please. Go on, Hank."
Hank,"Right, well, look at it this way, okay? It's the bottom of the 9th. Bases are loaded. You're up. But you got a bum arm. Right? There's no frickin' way you're gonna hit a homer. So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold onto your pride and lose the game. Get what I'm saying?"
Walter,No.
Hank,"You got your pride, man. I get it. Okay? I get it. If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, I'm with your old lady on this one. I say take the money and run, you know? Somebody wanna to take this thing? Here."
Skyler,"Yes, Walter Jr, I'm sure you have about a million things to say, probably, and now is your chance. Go ahead. Just let it all out."
Walter Jr,This is bullshit.
Walter,"Hey, come on."
Skyler,It's all right. Talk. Tell your dad how you feel.
Walter Jr,I'm pissed off.
Skyler,Tell him.
Walter Jr,"I'm pissed off, 'cause you're being, you're a p*ssy. You're, like, ready to give up. What if you gave up on me, huh? This here? All the stuff I've been through, and you're scared of a little chemotherapy?"
Marie,"Me, personally? I think you should do whatever you want to do."
Skyler,What?
Marie,You told us to be honest about our feelings. Walt's the one with cancer. It's his decision. It's not up to any of us.
Skyler,Why in the hell would you do this?
Marie,I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt. But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it.
Skyler,He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.
Marie,"I am a medical professional. I x-ray people in treatment every day. I see them every day, and you know what? Some of them are absolutely miserable."
Skyler,Marie.
Marie,"I'm sorry, but it's true. And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors. But they got talked into it by their families."
Hank,Could I get the pillow back? I agree with Marie on that. What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man.
Skyler,"I don't want him to die at all! That's the whole point of this. So either help, or leave!"
Marie,"Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion."
Skyler,"You know, Marie, this is not a debate club. This is my husband's life."
Marie,I make one simple observation.
Skyler,My husband's life we're talking about!
Hank,Ladies. Come on.
Skyler,How dare you?
Walter Jr,This is so stupid.
Walter,"All right, I've got the Talking Pillow now. Okay? We all, in this room, we love each other. We want what's best for each other, and I know that. I am very thankful for that. But what I want, what I need, is a choice."
Skyler,What does that mean?
Walter,"Sometimes, I feel like I never actually make any of my own. Choices, I mean. My entire life, it just seems I never you know, had a real say about any of it. Now this last one, cancer all I have left is how I choose to approach this."
Skyler,"Then make the right choice, Walt. You're not the only one it affects. What about your son? Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up?"
Walter,"Of course, I do. Skyler, you've read the statistics. These doctors, talking about surviving. One year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters. But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love? For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house. I want to sleep in my own bed. I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day, lose my hair, and lie around, too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can't even move my head. And you cleaning up after me? Me, with some dead man, some artificially alive, just marking time? No. No. And that's how you would remember me. That's the worst part. So that is my thought process, Skyler. I'm sorry. I just, I choose not to do it."
Walter,All right.
Skyler,All right what?
Walter,I'll do the treatment. It's gonna be okay.
Skyler,"The lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly, but since our HMO is not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card."
Walter,Good.
Skyler,And then Elliott will send a check.
Walter,I will take care of it.
Nurse,Walter White?
Walter,Yes.
Skyler,Okay. See you in a minute.
Walter,Elliott.
Gretchen,"Walt, it's Gretchen."
Walter,"Oh, hey. Hey, Gretchen. How are you? You know, it was really great seeing you two the other day. What a party."
Gretchen,Elliott told me about the cancer. I'm so sorry.
Walter,"Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess."
Gretchen,I don't know what to say except I'm always here for you. Both of us are. We wanted you to know that.
Walter,"Yeah, well, thank you."
Gretchen,"Walt, Elliott's told me he had offered to pay for the treatment. You have to accept. That money, as far as we're both concerned, that belongs to you. Even the name of our company, it's half yours. Walt Is this about you and me?"
Walter,"Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer. I do. But we're fine. As it turns out, the insurance came through after all. So I am covered. Well, anyway, I really appreciate it. Thank you."
Gretchen,"Good, that's good news."
Walter,"You know, that really was a great party."
Gretchen,"Keep in touch, okay?"
Walter,Sure. Sure. Thank you for calling.
Jesse,Yo!
Walter,You wanna cook?
Walter,"Let's get something straight. This, the chemistry, is my realm. I am in charge of the cooking. Out there on the street, you deal with that. As far as our customers go, I don't wanna know anything about them. I don't want to see them. I don't want to hear from them. I want no interaction with them whatsoever. This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner. You got any issues with that?"
Jesse,"Whatever, man."
Walter,"No matter what happens, no more bloodshed. No violence."
Skyler,Walt? You all right?
Walter,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. You know, honey, you really don't have to…"
Skyler,"Look, I like being here with you."
Walter,"I'm only saying that, I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go. You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr. gets home from school."
Skyler,Okay. All right. You'll call me when you're finished?
Walter,"Oh, yeah."
Skyler,And have you been in touch with Elliott? Because I haven't seen a check from him.
Walter,"Yes, I got it."
Skyler,Really?
Walter,"It came, yeah. Yeah, it came last week, and I put it right into my credit union account, all taken care of it."
Skyler,Good.
Walter,So we're good. We're good.
Walter,Could you not deposit this until Monday? Thank you.
Pharmacist,"Call if the discomfort is too much. Otherwise, we'll see you next week."
Walter,Yeah.
Walter,"Chemical reactions involve change on two levels  matter and energy. When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight. I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening. For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car. But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy. Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction? Hint, hint. Right here.
Student  Like an expl*si*n?"
Walter,"Yes. Good. Explosions. Explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously. And the faster reactants, i. e. , expl*sives, and fulminated mercury is a prime example of that, the faster they undergo change, the more violent the expl*si*n. So explosions. Okay, listen. Why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7, all right?"
Hugo,"You okay? I got it, Mr. White. Don't worry. You got kids to teach."
Walter,"Thanks, Hugo."
Skyler,"He's starting to lose weight, which is tough to see that. You know, to feel the difference when I put my arms around him. Can I talk to him?"
Counselor,Of course.
Skyler,"Walt when you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on, I think it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes."
Walter,No.
Skyler,"And recently these afternoons, when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are."
Walter Jr,"Yeah, Dad. What's up with that?"
Counselor,"Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family? Now's the time to share."
Walter,"Well I like to be alone, I mean at times, and it's not about you, really. It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything, to anyone."
Counselor,Alone time can be helpful for some types. Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.
Walter,"Well I like to go on walks a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work. And I really enjoy nature. You know, the cacti, the vegetation, that kind of thing. It's really very therapeutic."
Jesse,Yo! You okay? Did you breathe that shit?
Walter,No. I'm just dizzy.
Jesse,"Come here. Sit down, sit down."
Walter,I'm burning up.
Jesse,Take this off. Sit down. Get some air.
Walter,"Oh, God. Yeah, that's better."
Jesse,When were you going to tell me?
Walter,Tell you what?
Jesse,"Cancer. You got it, right?"
Walter,How did you know?
Jesse,"My aunt had one of those dots on her, to target the radiation. What is it in your lung? I'm your partner, man. You should have told me. That's not cool, okay? Not at all. What stage are you?"
Walter,3a.
Jesse,Gone to your lymph nodes.
Walter,Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it?
Jesse,Bad enough. She didn't last long.
Walter,How long?
Jesse,Seven months. I get it now. That's why you're doing all this. You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
Walter,You got a problem with that?
Jesse,You tell me. You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave. You going to be able to finish the batch?
Walter,Yes.
Jesse,All right.
Walter,No. You do it.
Jesse,Me?
Walter,"Yeah. What happened to your mad skills? Go on. Here. You do it. You can do it. If you have any questions, I'll be right out here."
Jesse,"The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo. My aunt said it helped with the hair loss."
Hank,"What's this? Christmas? This the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook site? Holy shit."
Steve,What?
Hank,Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing that used to be on the inside. Old Magic Marker or something.
Steve,Yeah? What's it say?
Hank,"""Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab."" That's Walt's school."
Walter,We were supposed to start at 3.
Jesse,"I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill. Hey. Prepaid cell phone. Use it."
Walter,How much is this?
Jesse,26 big ones.
Walter,"Is that all? $26,000?"
Jesse,"No, that's 26 hundred, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone."
Walter,How much meth did you sell?
Jesse,Nearly an ounce.
Walter,"Last time I checked, there were 16 ounces to a pound. You smoked the rest?"
Jesse,I've been out there all night slinging crystal. You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?
Walter,Why are you selling it in such small quantities? Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?
Jesse,"To who? What do I look like, Scarface?"
Walter,This is unacceptable. I am breaking the law here. This return is too little for the risk. I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
Jesse,"You may know a lot about chemistry, but you don't know jack about slinging dope."
Walter,"Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it. You've got to be more imaginative, you know? Just think outside the box here. We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale, now. How do we do that?"
Jesse,"What do you mean, to a distributor?"
Walter,Yes. Yes. That's what we need. We need a distributor now. Do you know anyone like that?
Jesse,"Yeah, I mean I used to until you k*lled him."
Walter,So who took Krazy-8's place?
Jesse,"Some guy named Tuco. A bad ass, from what I hear."
Walter,"Tuco, okay. So then just go talk to Tuco."
Jesse,"Right. Like, ""Hello, sir. Hey, I know you don't know me, but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"""
Walter,"Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?"
Jesse,"You just don't get it, man. This guy's O.G."
Walter,What does that mean?
Jesse,"Jesus, look, he's upper level, man. He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know. You don't understand the way it works. You can't just bum rush some high-level iceman and start cutting deals, okay? It's risky. You need an intro. You need someone to vouch."
Walter,"Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?"
Jesse,"Emilio. That's only because I knew him from, like, third grade. We can't talk to Emilio, either."
Walter,"All right, all right."
Jesse,"Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay? I mean, we're making money. Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is?"
Walter,Jesus! Just grow some f*cking balls!
Teller,Wait till Monday again?
Walter,"Yes, please. Thank you."
Hugo,Mr. White.
Walter,"Thank you, Hugo."
Carmen,Knock-knock.
Walter,"Oh, hey."
Carmen,"How are you feeling, Walt?"
Walter,Good.
Carmen,Are you up for having a visitor?
Hank,"Hey, buddy."
Walter,Hank.
Carmen,Let me know if you need anything.
Walter,"I will. Thank you, Carmen."
Carmen,No problem.
Hank,Damn. That chick's got an ass like an onion. Makes me want to cry.
Walter,So what are you doing here?
Hank,"Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, work-related. You okay? I could come back later."
Walter,"No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Everything's fine. What do you mean work-related, though?"
Hank,Do you recognize that?
Walter,No.
Hank,That was used to cook meth. Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here. Old label on the inside used to say J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.
Walter,Really? I don't understand how that came from here.
Hank,I was hoping you could help me. We found it near an abandoned car belonging to one of our snitches.
Walter,A snitch?
Hank,"Yeah, one of our confidential informants. Went missing a while back. No body yet, but we're pretty sure he's, you know. Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards. Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately?"
Walter,"No. No. No, I mean, not that I know of."
Hank,I'll need to take a look at that inventory.
Walter,Sure. I got a list hanging on the wall.
Hank,You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?
Walter,"Not at all, no. Be my guest."
Hank,Right. So who's got keys?
Walter,"Well, the science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice principal has the master, and me."
Hank,How about students?
Walter,"No, no. No students have keys."
Hank,I should hope not. My question is do any know where you keep them?
Walter,"I don't think so. No. Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so…"
Hank,"Walt, look, I know they're your students, but, do not underestimate them. Big mistake. Are there any other respirators?"
Walter,"Uh, no."
Hank,Because I'm counting six. Inventory says eight. Glassware looking a little sparse.
Walter,Is it?
Hank,"Yeah. You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least. Oh, yeah. A 5,000 milliliter round bottom. Meth heads love to brew in this, baby. Going to answer that?"
Walter,"No, it's just, no, I don't."
Hank,"Maybe it's Skyler. She's in trouble or something. Don't ignore it on my account. Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do. Jeez."
Walter,Okay. Hello.
Jesse,"Yo. What's up, Mr. W?"
Walter,Speaking.
Jesse,Bad time to talk?
Walter,Absolutely.
Jesse,"All right, so just listen. You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco? Turns out my boy Skinny Pete was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas. So we got our in. We're hauling a pound to the dude right now."
Walter,"Okay, then. Thank you very much for calling. My doctor is very solicitous."
Hank,"Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water, but some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay? You got to keep a better watch over your turf."
Walter,I will.
Hank,"We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?"
Walter,Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.
Jesse,So you're sure you're tight with this guy?
Skinny Pete,"Two nuts in a ball sack, yo. Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!"
Jesse,"Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come on."
Skinny Pete,"Atta man. That's what's happening. Yo, Tuco's expecting us. No need, man. Me and Tuco go back. Tuco. What's happening, my brother? Sick crib, yo. You been keeping it real since you been sprung. What's it been, like a year?"
Tuco,This your boy?
Skinny Pete,"Yeah, Jesse. The dude with the glass I was telling you about."
Jesse,"Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you."
Tuco,Break out the ice. Take a bump.
Jesse,"No worries, man. I'm no cop."
Tuco,I said hit it.
Jesse,All right.
Tuco,Boo ya! Woo! This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape. Woo! Where'd you get it?
Jesse,I cooked it.
Tuco,Bullshit! Who you working for?
Jesse,"No one, man. I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it."
Tuco,All right. We got a deal.
Skinny Pete,See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.
Jesse,Cool. I haven't said how much.
Tuco,All right. How much?
Jesse,35 large for the pound.
Tuco,"Well, you're a little light, ese. It's all right. Don't sweat it. It's all good. It's good. Go on. Get out of here."
Jesse,What about the money?
Tuco,You'll get it. This is a consignment operation.
Jesse,You want me to float 35 G's?
Tuco,You don't trust me?
Jesse,"No, no. Hey, it's not that, man. It's just, you know, I don't do business that way."
Tuco,Tough shit! The deal is done!
Jesse,You said this was cool. Get money for meth. Cash up front.
Skinny Pete,"Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it."
Tuco,I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!
Jesse,"Come on! Oh, come on!"
Tuco,"All right, you brought me some really clean crystal. Do you really want your money up front? Up front. Nobody moves crystal in the South Valley but me, bitch!"
Hank,"Good morning, Hugo. Don't mind if I call you Hugo, Hugo?"
Walter Jr,Is that Uncle Hank? Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.
Carmen,This doesn't make any sense to me at all. I don't understand.
Hank,I got two words for you  background check. How about that?
Jesse,"Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone."
Walter,Where the hell are you? Call me back.
Skyler,"Hey, Walt."
Walter,Yeah?
Skyler,Hank's about to deal.
Walter,Okay. I'll be right there.
Hank,All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.
Marie,"You're looking good, Walt. Your color's better."
Walter,Yeah? Thanks.
Skyler,"He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now. Dr. Delcavoli is trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but..."
Walter,"Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning, and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks. I just didn't have a chance to tell you. Sorry."
Hank,"Your bet, tough guy."
Walter Jr,Check.
Skyler,Yeah. Check.
Marie,Check's in the mail. 10 million.
Hank,Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.
Marie,Then 25 million because that's how I roll.
Walter Jr,"Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting Mr. Archuleta the other day? He's a pretty cool guy."
Hank,"Well, turns out that he has a record. Yeah. Couple of possession beefs. We figure he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear. I mean, you know, he had a key. Fit the profile. When we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt, which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all. It's to you, Walt."
Walter,"Yeah, I'll call."
Skyler,"I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record. I mean, that's pretty scary. How could something like that just slip through the cracks?"
Walter,"I don't know. I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief."
Hank,"Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia. Now, that said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart. Turns out he's a major league pothead. But he didn't raid your chemistry set. You hiding something?"
Walter,I'm in.
Walter Jr,"Yeah, I got nothing."
Skyler,I'm out.
Marie,I'm out.
Hank,"Yowsa! When old ""holes in her purse"" bails, you know you're in deep. Looks like it's you and me, buddy."
Walter,What's going to happen to him? Hugo.
Hank,"Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job, like he should. Probably spend a couple months in County, as it's not his first rap. I'm waiting. You going to man up, or you're going to puss out?"
Skyler,Hank.
Hank,What? Sorry.
Walter,I'm all in.
Hank,"No. You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar. What are you smoking there, huh? You got a heart? You got the flush, don't you? Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold."
Marie,"Talk about anti-climactic. Your cards couldn't have been that bad. Oh, my God. You threw away an ace..."
Hank,What are you doing? Don't.
Marie,"...and a cowboy, for...a handful of nothing."
Walter,"Who is this? I was dialing Jesse Pinkman. Well, where is he, then?"
Skinny Pete,You the guy?
Walter,"Yeah, I'm the guy. How is he?"
Skinny Pete,"Got some busted ribs and like that. Got messed up pretty good. I was all like ""Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."" I don't know what got into him. Seriously. Oh, he's out, man, way out. They got him doped up big-time. So you're the cook, huh? Yo, I didn't catch your name."
Walter,Tell me about this Tuco. Tell me everything about him.
Walter,"Good morning. Would you pass the butter, please?"
Walter Jr,"Bad ass, Dad."
Walter,"You Tuco? I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do."
Tuco,What's your name?
Walter,Heisenberg.
Tuco,"Heisenberg. Okay. Have a seat, Heisenberg."
Walter,I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
Tuco,No? All right. Be that way. It's your meeting. Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want?
Walter,"$50,000."
Tuco,"Oh, man! 50 G's? How you figure that?"
Walter,35 for the pound of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.
Tuco,"Partner. Oh, yeah. I remember that little bitch. So you must be Daddy. Let me get this straight. I steal your dope, hmm? I beat the piss out of your mule boy! And then you walk in here, and you bring me more meth? That's a brilliant plan, ese. Brilliant."
Walter,You got one part of that wrong. This is not meth.
Tuco,Are you f*cking nuts?
Walter,You want to find out?
Tuco,"No-Doze, Gonzo, calma! Calma. Calma. You got balls. I'll give you that. All right. All right. I'll give you your money. That crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than $10 ass in TJ. What say you bring me another pound next week?"
Walter,Money up front.
Tuco,All right. Money up front. Sometimes you gotta rob to keep your riches. Just as long as we got an understanding.
Walter,One pound is not going to cut it. You have to take two.
Tuco,"Hey, what is that shit?"
Walter,Fulminated mercury. A little tweak of chemistry.
Superintendent,"In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously. APD as well as the DEA. Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines remains one of our highest priorities. And the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention. Rest assured, no stone will go unturned in our search for the person or persons responsible for this. If you have any questions, now would be the time."
Parent,You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet. What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school?
Carmen,"There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs. He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car, not in the school. And he's since been fired."
Parent,I heard he had a record. I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place. Why wasn't there a background check?
Carmen,There was one. We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.
Parent,You better be doing more than that. He was arrested in front of my daughter.
Parent,"This guy was stealing the lab equipment, right?"
Cop,"That's not our thinking at this time. We are looking at others who had access, not limited to the maintenance staff."
Parent,"Are you saying there was a break-in? Do we know exactly when this happened? I mean, could it have been during school hours?"
Cop,"We haven't been able to establish a date or time, but there is no sign of breaking or entering."
Parent,Whoever took it had a key? We're talking inside job? Someone who's still at the school?
Cop,"At this time I'm not able to discuss the details, but what I can tell you is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case."
Parent,"I'm sorry, Officer. But that sounds like double-talk. We're trying to protect our children. You have to level with us."
Cop,"Really, we are giving you all the information we have."
Parent,You know what I'd like to see in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.
Parent,"Yeah, dogs, and metal detectors, and locker searches, and strip searches."
Superintendent,Our district has strict policies.
Parent,I heard about this school in Canada. They arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs. And the next day they found out over half of the students were high on LSD.
Parent,LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD?
Carmen,No. Please. No one said anything about LSD.
Parent,What about the equipment that was stolen?
Carmen,The equipment was taken from our chemistry department. And I would like someone to give us some specifics. Walt?
Walter,Yeah.
Carmen,"Mr. White is currently on medical leave. But as he's chair of the science department, he's made a very special effort to be with us here. And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that. Could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken? Please."
Walter,"Yes. And thank you. The inventory list for the missing labware is as follows  one 5,000 milliliter round bottom boiling flask, one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, two full-face respirators, some sep funnels, a sill head with a thermometer holder."
Skyler,Where did that come from? And why was it so damn good?
Walter,Because it was illegal.
Real Estate Agent,"The basement. Unfinished, of course. But just look at all this space. You gotta think rec room, media room. Just imagine all the things you could do down here. Now remember, you're buying for this fantastic neighborhood. Big lawns and shade tress. Walking distance to the country club."
Buyer,What happened there?
Realtor,"Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones."
Realtor,"You know what? We're zeroing in. I've got another listing, brand-new, right around the corner. Hi. Hi. It's by appointment only."
Walter,I'm here to see the owner.
Realtor,"He's in the recreational vehicle.
Scene  RV"
Jesse,"Yo, it's appointment only!"
Walter,How you feeling?
Jesse,"About as good as you look. Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor."
Walter,"Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep."
Jesse,"Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address. Acting like you were all out for blood. You are alive, so obviously you wised up."
Walter,"No, I did go see him."
Jesse,Bullshit.
Walter,Are you selling your house?
Jesse,I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushies and flushed down my toilet. I can't even take a proper dump in there. The whole damn house has got to be haunted by now. You didn't actually go see Tuco?
Walter,"Here. That is seventeen-five. Your half of the 35,000. Plus there's an extra 15 in there. It's all yours. You've earned it."
Jesse,You got this money from Tuco.
Walter,Yeah.
Jesse,So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.
Walter,We made a deal.
Jesse,You made a deal?
Walter,That's right.
Jesse,Wait. Why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me?
Walter,Because I think that we can do business together. We came to an understanding.
Jesse,"No way, man! Okay? No understanding."
Walter,Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week.
Jesse,"Without even talking to me, you told this insane ass clown dead-eyed k*ller that, uh that we would give him two pounds a week?"
Walter,We'll just scale up our operation. We'll add a few more hours.
Jesse,"Don't talk to me about hours. What about pseudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us? It takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces to meet up with my smurfs."
Walter,Smurfs?
Jesse,"Dudes who go to the drugstores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me. And that's maybe only good for, like, maybe a half-pound worth. See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan. All right. Of course you would have known that if you would have just asked me."
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, here we are again."
Skyler,Here we are.
Dr. Delcavoli,"Skyler, you look great."
Skyler,Thank you.
Dr. Delcavoli,"You must be, what, six, seven months? How goes it?"
Skyler,It's great other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.
Walter,The baby shower's next week. It'll be good to have a day that's just about Skyler.
Dr. Delcavoli,Very nice.
Skyler,Thank you.
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, Walt, I see you've committed to the hair loss."
Walter,Yeah.
Dr. Delcavoli,How do you feel?
Walter,"Oh, okay. You know, pretty decent actually."
Skyler,"His color is better. You know, his energy. And he's even more physical."
Dr. Delcavoli,More physical?
Skyler,"Well sexual. Frisky, actually. I mean, that's got to be a good sign, right?"
Dr. Delcavoli,"Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?"
Skyler,Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working?
Dr. Delcavoli,"Realistically, it may just mean that we've got the anti-emetics tuned right. Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo and we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure."
Skyler,"Isn't there anything else we could be doing? I've been wondering about alternative medicine. I mean, Eastern healing. You know, holistic."
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, I can't speak to its efficacy. But as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment, anything that helps my patient have a better outlook, a better comfort, is fine by me."
Skyler,So you're saying it's all psychological. It doesn't make any real difference.
Dr. Delcavoli,Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference. But it's also important that we manage our expectations.
Walter,What?
Jesse,"A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?"
Walter,What's wrong with it? It's private.
Jesse,"This is like a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, ""Ooh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me."""
Walter,So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.
Jesse,"I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open 24 hours. Nobody ever gets sh*t at Taco Cabeza. Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap. ""Hey! It's time for the meet. You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius.” Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death."
Walter,"Look, you don't have to be here for this. Okay? I mean, seriously. I'm okay."
Jesse,"Nah, I'm no p*ssy. I'm good."
Tuco,"Mr. Clean and his boy. I'm sorry that I had to tune you up. Respect, ese. You gotta give it to get it. Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here? What, they close the mall or something? Heisenberg, come on, break it out. That's it? That's all you got?"
Walter,We had some production problems.
No Doze,Point five-three.
Tuco,"I thought you was a player. You told me two pounds, and now you waste my time with these Chiclets? 17 and a half. Minus the half for wasting my time.
Walter  Hey, come on."
Tuco,"What, you're gonna argue? You got something to say? You're doing business like a couple little bitches."
Walter,I want all of it. 70 grand.
Tuco,What did you say?
Walter,"You like this product, and you want more. Consider it a capital investment."
Tuco,"Loco bald m*therf*cker. 52 and a half, 25 points vig."
Walter,Vig?
Jesse,Interest. Weekly.
Walter,"Okay. That's $65,625 with interest. 1.875 pounds."
Tuco,No. 2 pounds. Next Friday. And no production problems.
Walter,Can you handle 4 pounds?
Tuco,"Listen, old man. Talk is talk. But owing me money that's bad."
Jesse,What did you just do?
Jesse,4 pounds. 4 pounds cause’ 2 pounds wasn't bad enough. We're talking 200-300 boxes of sinus pills. There ain't that many smurfs in the world.
Walter,"We're not going to need pseudoephedrine. We're going to make phenylacetone in a tube furnace, then we're gonna use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds."
Jesse,So no pseudo?
Walter,No pseudo.
Jesse,"So you do have a plan. Yeah, Mr. White! Yeah, science!"
Walter,Okay.
Jesse,What's this?
Walter,That is a shopping list. Getting some of those items may be challenging.
Jesse,"""One autotransformer, hy...hydrous methyl...methylamine, two 35 M&M tube furnaces."""
Walter,"That's MM  millimeter. One 70-millimeter would be fine, but they're hard to come by, so."
Jesse,"""40 grams thorium nitrate?” Yo, Mr. White, I can't even pronounce half this shit. You know what? Count me out. I'm leaving town. I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something."
Walter,"Jesse, Jesse, listen to me. Today is the first day of the rest of your life."
Jesse,What are you doing?
Walter,"This is the first day of the rest of your life, but what kind of life will it be? Will it be a life of fear, of ""Oh, no, no, no, ""I can't do this,"" of never once believing in yourself?"
Jesse,I don't know.
Walter,Listen. These things? We need them. And only you can get them for us.
Walter Jr,"Okay, it's ready. There you go."
Marie,"Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie. Now, you already know that because when you watch this 20 years from now, I will look exactly the same as I do now. I know it is amazing. I have aged shockingly well, haven't I? Anyway, welcome to your baby shower, Esmeralda!"
Walter Jr,Esmeralda?
Marie,"Esmeralda. That's your name, and you heard it here first. Now, that is your wonderful, handsome older brother. Show her, older brother, your face. Okay. Not right up the nose. Back to me. There's your mommy! Hello, Mommy! And look! There you are, Esmeralda! Wake up, baby! Time to party!"
Skyler,"Easy. Believe it or not, Esmeralda, right after the party, your name was changed to Holly. And I believe, Hank, that was around the time that we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum."
Hank,"Yeah, yeah. I dropped her off at the curb. Then I married Shania Twain and lived happily ever after."
Marie,"There's Daddy! Speak, Daddy! Say hello to your daughter."
Walter,"Holly, I am very proud of you, and I think about you all the time. Wherever you go, whatever you do in life, always know that you have a family who loves you very, very much. Cheers."
Everyone,Cheers!
Skyler,"Oh, my God, it's so cute. Oh, Carmen, it's oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable. I love it, Carmen. Thank you."
Carmen,"You're so welcome, honey."
Skyler,Thank you. Look at the little feet.
Marie,From me. And Hank.
Skyler,What nice wrapping paper. Marie always finds the best wrapping paper.
Marie,I do.
Skyler,"Okay. Let's see what this is. Exciting. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's a tiara. Marie, is this…"
Marie,White gold and several carats' worth of zircons.
Skyler,"Oh, Marie, you spent too much on this. You shouldn't have. You really, really shouldn't. But it's so, it's really, it's sparkly. Sparkly! Like wow! Thank you."
Hank,"Hey, listen, Walt, you got anything stronger than beer?"
Hank,"Sorry, man. You know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old. That's nice stuff."
Walter,"It is, isn't it?"
Hank,I got just the thing to go with that. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
Walter,"No, no, no, no. It's okay. You mind if I have one?"
Hank,You think it's a good idea?
Walter,"Hank, I've already got lung cancer."
Hank,Okay. You got me there.
Walter,Thanks. Cuban.
Hank,I did a little favor for an FBI guy.
Walter,"Now, I was under the impression that these were illegal, hmm?"
Hank,"Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?"
Walter,"It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line."
Hank,Yeah? What line is that?
Walter,"Well, what's legal, what's illegal, Cuban cigars, alcohol. You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law. Another year, we'd be okay. Who knows what will be legal next year?"
Hank,You mean like pot?
Walter,Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.
Hank,coca1ne? hero1n?
Walter,I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
Hank,"Well, you ought to visit lockup. You hear a lot of guys talking like that. ""Hey, man, why'd you bust me with these 14 bales of ganja? It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president."" Shit, buddy, it doesn't only go one way, either. Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be. I mean, friggin' meth used to be legal. Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America. Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?"
Walter,Yeah.
Walter,Nice party.
Skyler,A tiara. A white gold tiara for a newborn baby.
Walter,Yeah.
Skyler,"You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill. I mean, that thing must have cost, like, what, $500 or $600. You know what? I think I'm going to return it."
Walter,You sure? She's bound to find out.
Skyler,"Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie more than a white gold baby tiara."
Walter,"You know, I've been thinking about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli about alternative medicine."
Skyler,Don't worry. I'm not going to mention that anymore.
Walter,"What I mean is that maybe there is something to it. Here. Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington. Healing ceremony. It's supposed to be good for your lungs. I'm not saying that I believe in it, but you know, it might be an experience."
Skyler,Really? You? In a sweat lodge?
Walter,"I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday. I mean, if you're okay with it."
Skyler,"Well, of course I'm okay with that."
Walter,Okay.
Jesse,Sweat lodge?
Walter,Yeah.
Jesse,I'm already sweating. Help me out.
Walter,Okay. Right. Excellent. This is excellent. Very good work.
Jesse,Damn straight.
Walter,"Okay. Hydrogen. Electrolytically produced, yes?"
Jesse,"Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this crap wasn't easy to get. It was expensive."
Walter,Methylamine. Where's the methylamine? I don't see the methylamine.
Jesse,"Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble."
Walter,What kind of trouble?
Jesse,"Well, half this crap I could just buy, right? But this methylamine, not so easy. They got it locked down tight. But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us. But they want 10 grand."
Walter,So what's the problem? You have the money.
Jesse,"No, had. I already spent almost the whole wad. I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left. I told you, all this crap was expensive."
Walter,"So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from?"
Jesse,"Yeah, a chemical supply place south of town. They got guards and security cameras, big ass steel doors. That's why these dudes are charging so much. What?"
Walter,So why don't we just steal it ourselves?
Jesse,Yeah? How are we going to do that?
Walter,With this.
Jesse,So what's this stuff called again?
Walter,Thermite.
Jesse,And that will cut through a lock? Because this is supposed to be one big ass lock.
Walter,"In World w*r II, the Germans had an a*tillery piece, it's the biggest in the world, called the Gustav g*n, and it weighed a thousand tons. And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7-ton shell and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away. I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without ever disabling it. But you drop a commando, one man, with just a bag of this and he could melt right through and destroy that g*n forever."
Jesse,Jeez!
Walter,So yes. I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.
Manager,You'd like to return this?
Skyler,"It's very nice, but yes. Well, it is from the store, isn't it?"
Manager,"Oh, yes. It's from this store. Do you happen to have a receipt?"
Skyler,No. I don't. It was a gift.
Manager,"A gift. Mr. Wilson, could you step over here, please? Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady while I phone the police."
Skyler,Excuse me?
Manager,"Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know. Come with me, please."
Manager,"Oh, yes. I intend to press charges. Please do. We'll be here."
Skyler,"Look, I've never stolen anything in my life, all right? I told you. That tiara was a gift. A baby shower gift."
Manager,"So who gave it to you, then?"
Skyler,I don't think I have to tell you that.
Manager,"You don't have to tell me anything. You can talk to the police, and I can tell them how my daughter-in-law remembers showing this particular item to a tall blonde woman who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it. So there."
Skyler,"Oh, yeah? Then I can talk to the Channel 3 News. Yeah. I can tell them how you people, without a shred, without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom."
Manager,This is my office.
Skyler,"I feel I'm being held hostage. Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here. I don't think I can breathe. Oh, my God. Oh, no. I'm going into labor."
Marie,You've reached Marie. Do the beep thing.
Skyler,Marie? It's Skyler. I just left Zachary's. I need to talk to you immediately.
Walter,Where's the guard?
Jesse,He's supposed to be coming by. You think he already passed?
Walter,I don't know. There he is.
Jesse,"Yeah, I see him."
Walter,Wait till he passes.
Jesse,"Okay, it's clear. What the hell is this?"
Walter,It's all they had.
Jesse,"Then you go to another store. If this is all they had, wrong place."
Walter,"Just put it on. Okay. This is it. Oh, God. Damn. Duck. Duck."
Jesse,"What? He's not supposed to come back. What's he doing? Oh, God. He's going to the crapper."
Walter,"Oh, God. Carry your bag."
Jesse,What? What are you doing?
Walter,"Okay, there is it."
Jesse,Is this going to be loud?
Walter,We'll find out in about ten seconds. Stand back.
Jesse,Jesus!
Walter,Where are the gallon jugs?
Jesse,I don't know.
Walter,God!
Jesse,What?
Walter,Let's just take this. Come on. Come on. What the hell are you doing opening the door?
Jesse,How are we going to take this thing out?
Walter,How is it going to be any different?
Jesse,Can I just try it?
Walter,"Fine, fine, go ahead. Jesus."
Jesse,"Okay. All right. Yeah, baby. See? Eat it, okay? I'm the king. I'm the king. No, no, no. That didn't sound good."
Walter,"Well, this thing's not going anywhere."
Jesse,We're not cooking in my damn driveway. I tell you that.
Walter,What part of slow it down did you not understand?
Jesse,"You talk too much. It's heavy, man."
Walter,"You got to wait for me. Okay. That's good, that's good. Now just bring it up. Easy, easy, easy. Okay. Your real estate agent, when is she supposed to come back?"
Jesse,"Shit. Yo, I don't know. I'll make damn sure she doesn't. Good call, yo."
Walter,All right. Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees. We'll need to run it two more hours to have enough to make 4 and a half pounds.
Jesse,"4 and a half, not 4?"
Walter,"Two pounds pays Tuco back. Four and a half pounds puts us $44,000 ahead. Each."
Jesse,"Right on, man. Right on."
Walter,"With the amount of methylamine that we got last night, we could make well, for the foreseeable future."
Jesse,How long is that going to be? I mean in your situation. How much cash do you need?
Walter,More.
Jesse,Someone's in my yard.
Walter,"Was there, by any chance, scheduled for this afternoon an open house?"
Jesse,"I left her a message, man. It's not my fault."
Walter,I don't care how you do it. Just keep them out of here. Do you understand?
Jesse,Yeah.
Walter,Go.
Skyler,You know you can't duck me forever.
Marie,What?
Skyler,"Come on. I left you, like, 15 messages. When I went to your office, you snuck out the back way."
Marie,"I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch. Jeez, Skyler, what are you, the paranoid police?"
Skyler,"Marie, I have never been so humiliated in my life. That tiara. They accused me at Zachary's of shoplifting it."
Marie,What were you doing at Zachary's?
Skyler,I was returning it.
Marie,You were returning it. Why would you return it?
Skyler,"It just wasn't...Marie, what is wrong with you? Can you please tell me that? Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing? What does that mean? Does that mean you don't know?"
Marie,That means that I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about.
Skyler,"You have no idea what I'm talking about. The shoplifting. No idea? You're not going to admit this, are you?"
Marie,I can't really admit to something when I have no knowledge of what it is that I'm admitting.
Real Estate Agent,Don't forget to sign in. Thank you. Thank you.
Buyer,Excuse me. I'd just like to see the basement.
Jesse,"Yeah, well, it's occupied."
Buyer,It's not a bathroom. I just want to see the basement. What's the big deal?
Jesse,"Yo, you ain't seeing the basement, bitch! You got that? Is that sinking in? Now beat it. All of you all. House is not for sale! Get the hell out!"
Skyler,So how was it? Was it an experience?
Walter,Yeah. It was definitely an experience.
Skyler,What's that smell?
Walter,"Yeah. It's sacred Navajo herbs and, hey, is everything okay?"
Skyler,"No. Not really. Actually, not at all. You know that tiara that Marie gave us?"
Walter,Yeah.
Skyler,"Well, she stole it. Yeah. I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store."
Walter,"Oh, my God."
Skyler,She refuses to admit it. She refuses to apologize. I don't know what to do.
Walter,"Oh, well. People sometimes do things for their families."
Skyler,"People sometimes do things for their families? And, what, that justifies stealing?"
Walter,Yeah.
Skyler,That must have been some sweat lodge. Have you been listening to the words coming out of your mouth?
Walter,What would you do if it were me?
Skyler,What do you mean if it were you?
Walter,"If it were me, what would you do? Would you divorce me? Would you turn me in to the police?"
Skyler,You don't want to find out. Do you want something to eat?
Walter,"No, thanks."
Tuco,What is this shit? This is blue.
Walter,"We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure."
Jesse,"It may be blue, but it's the b*mb."
Tuco,"Tight! Tight, tight, yeah! Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that. Come on. And what did I say, man? This guy can cook! You're all right, man. You're all right. We're going to make a lot of money together."
No Doze,Just remember who you're working for.
Tuco,What did you say?
No Doze,I'm just saying they got to know that they're working for you.
Tuco,Like they don't already know that? Are you saying that they're stupid?
No Doze,"No, I'm just saying."
Tuco,"Oh, yeah. So you're not saying that they're stupid. So I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm stupid?"
No Doze,"No. Come on, Tuco. I'm just saying."
Tuco,"No, you're just speaking for me! Like I ain't got the damn sense to speak for myself! Is that it? Is that what you're doing?"
Walter,"Tuco. Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?"
Tuco,"Heisenberg says relax. Orale, homes. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. Damn, man! Look at that! Look! Yeah. That's messed up. Okay, Heisenberg! Next week."
Tuco,What is this? It's blue.
Walter,"We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure."
Jesse,"May be blue, but it's the b*mb."
Tuco,"Tight, tight, tight! Yeah. Blue, yellow, pink! Whatever man, just keep bringing me that. You're all right. We're gonna make a lot of money together."
No Doze,Just remember who you're working for.
Tuco,What did you say?
No Doze,"I'm just saying, they gotta know that they're working for you."
Tuco,Like they don't already know that? Are you saying that they're stupid?
No Doze,"No, I'm just saying."
Tuco,"Oh yeah, so you're not saying that they're stupid? So, I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm stupid? Is that it? Is that what you're doing?"
Walter,Tuco. Why don't we all just relax?
Tuco,"Heisenberg says, ""relax. "" I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed Damn, man! Look at that! Look! Yeah. That's messed up. Okay, Heisenberg! Next week."
Walter,"Adjusting for inflation. Good state college, adjusting for inflation, say $45,000 a year. Two kids, four years of college, $360,000. Remaining mortgage on the home, 170,000. Home equity line, 30,000. That's 137,000. Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities, say two grand a month, and that should put a dent in it, anyway. 24k a year, provide for say, 10 years. That's $240,000. Plus 360, plus 137. 737. $737,000. That’s what I need. That is what I need. You and I both clear about 70 grand a week, that's only 10 1/2 more weeks. Call it 11. 11 more drug deals and always in a public place from now on. It's do-able. Definitely do-able."
Tuco,"Heisenberg! What the hell? What's wrong with him? What's the matter with you? You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?"
Gonzo,"Damn, Tuco."
Tuco,Shut up.
Walter,There's no pulse.
Tuco,Do something.
Walter,Do something? He needs an ambulance. He needs a hospital.
Tuco,"Do something! You're smart, right? Do that thing!"
Walter,"No, there's nothing."
Tuco,Breathe into his mouth.
Walter,"No, they don't teach that anymore. It doesn't work."
Tuco,"You, come here! Breathe into his mouth! Get rid of him."
Gonzo,"We can't do him like that, man. Buzzards and rats and all that. I'm just saying, you know? It's not very Christian."
Tuco,"It sounds like arguing. Gonzo, hurry up! What's the big hurry?"
Walter,I just think we're done here.
Tuco,You're done.
Skyler,"Hey, I'm back here! Hello? Didn't you hear me?"
Walter,Hey.
Skyler,"Hey, yourself. What, you can't answer when I'm calling you? Are you okay?"
Walter,Great.
Skyler,"New hat? I got some grilled chicken at Albertsons. You want me to heat some up for you? Where've you been? Do you know what, I've got all this crap on my face. Let me clean up first, okay? You know, Walter Junior's gonna be home any minute, so enough. Hold up. Stop it. Stop it! I know you're scared, and you're angry, and you're frustrated. And I know none of this is fair. But you cannot take it out on me."
Walter Jr,"Hey, I'm home!"
Jesse,"We are dead. Dead, man! Muerto! Or muerte! However the hell you..."
Walter,This is conjecture.
Jesse,This is conjecture?
Walter,Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
Jesse,"My conjecture isn't helping. Fine. Facts then. Fact A  My phone rang, like, eight times last night. Dead air, hang ups every time. Second fact  Like 3 in the morning I saw that black caddy of his cruising my neighborhood. No headlights."
Walter,"No if he wanted to k*ll us, he would've done it at the junkyard."
Jesse,"What is that? Conjecture? Are you basing that on that he's got a normal, healthy brain or something? Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing? And that way, that way he just kept staring at us, saying, ""You're done."" ""You're done""? You wanna know what that means? I will tell you what that means. That means exactly how it sounds, yo! All right. We are witnesses. We are loose ends. Right now, Tuco's thinking, ""Yeah, hey, they cook good meth, but can I trust them?"" What happens when he decides no?"
Walter,No.
Jesse,It's him or us! You understand? It is him or us!
Walter,How would you do it?
Jesse,What do you mean how would I do it?
Walter,"Specifically, how would you do it? Step by step."
Jesse,"Alright. Say we set up one last sale, this is providing he doesn't decide to waste us before then. Every time we bring in a new batch, he always tests the product, right? So, as his head is down you know, just giving it a snort, pop pop pop!"
Walter,Pop pop pop? So three shots?
Jesse,"Three shots, or, I don't know, two."
Walter,"But is it two, or is it three?"
Jesse,"Two would probably work, I guess, yeah."
Walter,Two shots in the chest? Or two shots in the face?
Jesse,"Man, come on."
Walter,"I'm just trying to understand how this works. All right. We'll put a pin in that. But by now, the big guy, Gonzo he's probably coming at you, right? So you turn toward him, how many shots for him? He's a big guy, right? How many shots does that take?"
Jesse,I don't know. Three shots.
Walter,"Okay, three shots. Tuco and Gonzo. Two men down. Now, is there anyone else there? I mean, Tuco is usually with someone else, right? Maybe even a couple of guys. His dealers, his posse. All right. So we'll put a pin in that one, too. Now, at this point, how many shots have been fired? You've gotta be running low. How many b*ll*ts does that g*n take? How can you suggest that we k*ll a man, and you can't even open the g*n? It's not that easy, is it?"
Jesse,"Hey, man, Walt, you did it."
Walter,Yeah.
Marie,Call Skyler.
Walter,"Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message."
Marie,"Well, aren't you an early bird, up and out already. The big lug and I are gonna go try that new restaurant over by UNM tonight. So let me know if you guys wanna hang. Listen to me. ""Hang."" Walt Junior would be proud. I know the lingo. I'm still hip. It's Chinese, the restaurant. I don't know. I just feel like Chinese. Do you think that people in China ever just feel like American? You know, and they go out and get little take-out boxes with mashed potatoes and meatloaf, and try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks? I wonder if that ever happens. All right. I'll let you go. So call me."
Hank,Skyler didn't pick up?
Marie,Obviously she's not home.
Hank,What was that about Chinese?
Marie,Dinner tonight. That new place.
Hank,How late they serve?
Marie,I don't know.
Hank,You got Dave at 8.
Marie,Not tonight.
Hank,"Yeah, you do. Remember?"
Marie,"No, that's Thursday. I'm pretty sure that's Thursday."
Hank,"Remember how, at the last minute, they changed it around for you? They were gonna charge us a penalty. Look, baby, you only got six more sessions."
Marie,"And I'm doing them, Hank. I said I would do them, and I'm doing them. I can't help it if you got your days of the week wrong."
Neighbor Kid,"Look out! Sorry, Mr. Schrader!"
Hank,"Look, it's you know, it's just I think Dave is really helping you. Sorry about that. She's..."
Prisoner,"Hey! Hey, where's my phone call? Ow!"
Steve,"Hits two in the sand, two in the forest. And then he says, ""Give me a four."""
Hank,Gomez. What do you got for me? Come on. Chop-chop.
Steve,"Good morning to you, too. APD sent this over. This was about eight or ten days ago. You know Southwest Aniline, right?"
Hank,"Yeah, off the 25? Whole place smells like feet."
Steve,This is them. Check this out.
Hank,Holy shit. What was that?
Steve,"Thermite. So they tell me. Burns about 5,000 degrees. Kind of stuff you see in a James Bond movie."
Hank,"Nice! Guys who know their trade. Wait. I take that back. What, they didn't think about stealing a hand truck? Try rolling it, morons! It's a barrel. It rolls. Jesus. So what'd they get?"
Steve,"Methylamine, 30 gallons."
Hank,P2P? They're cooking old-school biker meth. Who the hell still does that?
Steve,All the old-timers I know are either dead or in prison.
Hank,"Pseudo's in short supply, so these two make do by changing up the formula. That and the thermite I'd say these two know their chemistry."
Steve,But ranking them as burglars?
Hank,Shit! I wouldn't trust these two to break into the Special Olympics. They got book learnin' but no street skills.
Steve,Maybe they're college kids. Chem students trying to make a big score.
Hank,"Maybe. I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor. That big a score, they're gonna wind up stepping on some toes. Tell you what, they better pray it's us who catches up to them and not those boys from Juarez."
Skyler,Your daughter wants out.
Walter,"Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message."
Marie,"Hey, it's me. I thought I'd try you earlier this time, before you go out and, you know, face the day. I'm realizing now it probably takes you a little longer to get to the phone, owing to the extra baby weight..."
Walter,"Hey, sweetie."
Skyler,"Walt, did you spend the entire night out here?"
Walter,"No, no. Well, not all of it. Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of my stomach, you know? I knew I was gonna be up and down, so I just didn't want to wake you."
Walter,How would he know where I live?
Jesse,You're sure it was Tuco?
Walter,"Who else could it be? Did you ever tell him my name, where I live or anything? What about Gonzo, or the dead one? Did you tell them anything about me?"
Jesse,"I didn't say jack! Tuco must've put out, like, you know, feelers. He's got his ways and means, yo. Sources, all right? He's closing in."
Walter,"And what happens when he finds out that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent? Oh, God. What happens then?"
Jesse,"Look, it's got five b*ll*ts. I finally figured out how to. Look, I just finally figured it out. Say we get a second g*n, right, for you. I mean, don't we, like, double our chances? I mean, mathematically."
Walter,I've got a better idea.
Jesse,"Thank God! All right. What is it, Mr. White? Lay it on me."
Walter,Beans.
Jesse,Beans?
Walter,They're castor beans.
Jesse,"So what are we gonna do with them? Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk, huh? Climb it and escape?"
Walter,We are going to process them into ricin.
Jesse,Rice and beans?
Walter,Ricin. It's an extremely effective poison. It's toxic in small doses. Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy. All right. So...don't touch them.
Jesse,"Wait. Seriously, you can get poison from beans?"
Walter,"Back in the late '70s, ricin was used to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist. The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella to inject a tiny pellet into the man's leg. And we're talking about an amount not much bigger than the head of a pin."
Jesse,But it k*lled him?
Walter,"Now we just need to figure out a delivery device, and then no more Tuco."
Hank,How you doing? Is this a bad time?
Skyler,"No, come on in."
Hank,I should've called first. I'm sorry.
Skyler,What can I do for you?
Hank,Maybe we ought to sit down first?
Skyler,"I don't know, Hank. Depends on whether or not this is gonna be about Marie. Did she send you?"
Hank,"Hell, no. She's barely even talking to me. That's why I'm here, okay? Self-preservation. Big time. Look, I know you gals have your ups and downs. I get it. And I need to get involved like I need a second hole in my ass. But if you could do me this huge favor and just return her phone calls."
Skyler,"I don't think I'm quite ready to do that yet. You know, communication. Communication, right? The back, the forth."
Hank,"Come on. Sky, do this for me, please. You can yell at her. Just call her back."
Skyler,"Marie is a shoplifter, Hank. That's right. That ""baby tiara"" she gave me at the shower? She stole it from Gertrude Zachary's. I almost got arrested when I went back to return it. And Marie won't admit it. She won't apologize."
Hank,"Yeah. If I thought you were gonna return it, I would have never, you know."
Skyler,You knew about this?
Hank,"We're working on it. I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave. I mean, Dave is really good. Dave's good. But it's an ongoing process, Sky, and we have gotta be understanding. You know? I mean, we've gotta, you know. We've gotta support the shit out of her."
Skyler,"Do we? I need support. Me! The almost 40-year-old pregnant woman, with the surprise baby on the way. And the husband with the lung cancer who disappears for hours on end, and I don't know where he goes, and he barely even speaks to me anymore. With the moody son who does the same thing. And the overdrawn checking account. And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty-looking crap and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet and we can't even afford to fix it. But, oh, I see! Now I'm supposed to go, ""Hank, please.What can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the center of attention! Cause God knows she's the one with the really important problems!"""
Hank,Want me to take a look at that utility closet?
Jesse,That's all it takes?
Walter,That's all it takes.
Jesse,"So, now what?"
Walter,"Now, we arrange our next meet, in a public place this time. Nice and safe. Business as usual. And, uh, after we sell him our usual four pounds, then we'll pull this out. ""By the way, Tuco, the new meth formula we've been working on. Would you care to try it?"""
Jesse,"Okay, well, what's new about it? Just in case he asks. What do we say?"
Walter,"I don't know. Whatever you want. It gets the user insanely high. I mean, how much salesmanship do we really need? That degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on."
Jesse,"Okay, well, we'll just put a pin in that, then."
Walter,"Anyway, within the next 48 hours, maybe 72, it'll look like natural causes."
Jesse,"What, like a heart attack?"
Walter,"Or the flu, maybe. His associates won't know any differently, and we'll be in the clear."
Jesse,Not if Tuco kills us first.
Walter,"Just keep it down. Hey, Hank. What's up?"
Hank,"Hey, buddy. You been home yet?"
Walter,Why?
Hank,Well 'cause I really screwed up. I apologize in advance for the earful you're gonna hear from Skyler. I'm just trying to get her and Marie talking again. Big mistake. I should have just kept out of it.
Walter,"Yeah, well, okay."
Hank,"Me and my big mouth, I guess."
Walter,"Well, that happens. It's no problem. No worries."
Hank,"Well, thanks, man. I appreciate that. Jesus, the wives, huh?"
Walter,"Hank, unfortunately, I really..."
Hank,"Oh, yeah, man, don't let me keep you. Actually, I'm at work, so you wanna see something really freaky?"
Walter,"Well, I would, but..."
Hank,"Seriously, Walt, this is, you gotta check out this crime scene me and Gomie are at. Just a second. Hang on, hang on. It should be coming through right now. Guess it could be worse, huh? We could be having a day like these two. A couple of local bulletheads. Guess they pissed off the wrong guy. Walt, you there?"
Walter,I'm taking this.
Jesse,No! It's my g*n! I need it!
Walter,"No, you don't! Not if you leave town. Get out of here. Tuco k*ll*ing Gonzo means he's coming after us next. I've gotta get home. My family."
Walter,Where's Walter Junior?
Skyler,"Having dinner at Louis's house. Supposedly. All day, I've had the whole house to myself. So where have you been this time?"
Skyler,"Walt, will you come in here and talk to me please?"
Walter,I'll be right there.
Hank,"Yeah, I recognize these two knob jobs. Known associates of a psychotic piece of shit named Tuco Salamanca."
Steve,Guess he got tired of associating.
Hank,Do you mind if I get in there?
Agent,"No, go ahead."
Hank,"The big one smells fresher. You guys find a death wound? I see lots of blood, but no b*llet holes."
Agent,You done taking pictures? All right. Let's lay 'em out flat.
Hank,"Let me get out of your way here, man."
Steve,"Oh, snap!"
Hank,"Damn, Ricky. Leave something for the coroner. Oh, this is beautiful. Hey, someone call Jay Leno. We've got the world's dumbest criminal. This guy wasn't m*rder*d. Look. Big Stuff, here, was moving this guy's body, when the stack must have shifted. Crushed his arm, pinned him here, and he bled out!"
Steve,"Poetic justice. Oh, I love it."
Hank,"Don't you just? Get a photo of me with this guy, all right? Old Stumpy, here. Make sure you get the stump in there."
Skyler,"Would you talk to me, please?"
Walter,I don't know where to begin.
Walter,What the hell are you doing here?
Tuco,Get in. Get in. Let's go.
Hank,"All right, everybody. Listen up. Tuco Salamanca. For those of you not with us this morning, we raided his headquarters. Also his last known address. Even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend. We netted a bunch of his lieutenants. The big man himself smelled us coming. So study the face. Study the file. Get a big ol raging hard on at the idea of catching this piece of shit. My apologies to the HR department. Grow tumescent with anticipation. All right. On the hit parade, 1998. Reputed to have whacked ""Dog"" Paulson, back when our home-grown banditos where wrestling the crank trade away from the So Cal biker gangs. Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03. And for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals, I'd say he is a prime suspect in the disappearance of our dearly-missed Krazy-8. Hats over your heart for that dirtball. We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that one, but as usual, we couldn't make it stick. He runs a tight ship. Smug b*st*rd. And even worse, El Paso says he's got some kind of cartel connection. I know it's, we all know what's going on down there. We sure as hell don't want it going on up here. Which brings us to the good news. We finally got some actual, honest-to-God evidence. This is one of Tuco's henchmen. Street name, No Doze. Found him tucked in the junkyard, along with Tuco's own brother-in-law, A.K.A. Gonzo. Gonzo, this rocket scientist, was moving No Doze's body, either hiding it there or pulling it out, still not sure, when he got his arm crushed clean off. Anyone wanna see the photos, they're on my Website. Hilarious. Anyway. The upshot is, we got us a nice, big, juicy, bloody fingerprint, which belongs to senor Tuco. Christmas came early to the Schrader household. That is, provided we find this guy. So to all present, I ask you, you wanna find this guy?"
Everyone,Yeah!
Hank,What the hell was that? Jesus. Wanna try that again? Do you want to find this guy?
Everyone,Yeah!
Hank,Are we going to find this guy?
Everyone,Yeah!
Hank,"Louder, damn it!"
Everyone,Yeah!
Hank,"Give me a hell, yeah!"
Everyone,"Hell, yeah!"
Hank,"They ain't gonna find him. Guy's in Mexico by now. Appearances, Gomie. It's all about appearances. Listen, I gotta take some personal time."
Steve,"Now, in the middle of a manhunt?"
Hank,"Skyler called last night. It's Walt. He's missing. Just disappeared from the house, and no one's heard from him since."
Steve,Damn. You don't think he...Holler if you need me.
Hank,"Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that."
Skyler,"This is the most recent photo. We haven't taken many lately, but that's what he looks like now. Without the hair."
Hank,"Hey, it's me. Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you sparing us your day off."
Tim,"No worries. Happy to help. Yeah, this is helpful. Good. What about height and weight?"
Skyler,"Five eleven most recently, about 170. I guess he weighs a little less."
Tim,That's fine. That's close enough. Good. What about other distinguishing features? Tattoos or moles or scars? Anything that might help us.
Skyler,Tattoos? Not really.
Tim,That's fine. Is that the list of medications?
Skyler,"Yes. I wrote them all down. And there's no drug interactions. None that are listed. I called his doctor, so, no."
Tim,Has he been depressed?
Skyler,"He's been withdrawn lately. A little withdrawn. Last night, he was agitated."
Tim,Agitated.
Skyler,"Yeah. When he came home last night, he was agitated, upset."
Tim,Upset in general? Or upset because of something particular?
Skyler,"When I asked him what was wrong, he said ""I don't know where to begin."" Then he just walked out of the bathroom. I was in the tub. Taking a bath. And when I came out about ten minutes later, he was gone."
Tim,Nothing else missing?
Skyler,"His keys, wallet, cell phone. Just what was on him. What about the phone call?"
Hank,I'm looking into it.
Tim,What phone call?
Skyler,"Walt's cell phone rang. He pulled it out, looked at it, and didn't answer it. But then, a short time after, he wandered out of the bathroom. I mean couldn't that be important, right?"
Tim,Anything else you can think of?
Skyler,"Anything else. I called the credit card providers, and there's no report of any recent activity. Let's see I checked with every hospital within 50 miles. Every police station. Every morgue. So, no, I really don't. I don't have anything else. I was actually hoping that you had something else, being that you're the expert. I'm sorry."
Tim,No worries. I think this is good enough to start. Gives us plenty to work on.
Skyler,Thank you.
Hank,So that cell phone call she's talking about? I ran it.
Tim,And?
Hank,Never happened. No record of it.
Tim,Second cell phone.
Hank,Yeah. I'm thinkin' that.
Skyler (Walt’s Imagination),I understand.
Tuco,Out!
Jesse,Get away from me!
Tuco,"Settle down, bitch!"
Jesse,"You gonna sh**t me? sh**t me in here! I hope I bleed like a mother, too! That way, you have to clean it up!"
Tuco,"It's your ride, retard. I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out! Get up! Get up."
Walter,"Don't do this, Tuco.
Scene  White Residence"
Marie,No more posters?
Skyler,"Walter Junior's making more. Thank you, Marie."
Marie,"I don't think he'll hurt himself. I mean, he just doesn't strike me as the type. He'll turn up. Okay, the whole tiara thing I just find it bewildering that you didn't believe that..."
Skyler,Not now.
Tuco,"Empty your pockets. Thought your name was Heisenberg, ""Walter Hartwell White?"""
Walter,Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym. A business name.
Tuco,I like doing business with a family man. There's always a lot of collateral. Answer me one thing. Can I trust you?
Walter,"Yes, absolutely."
Tuco,"Sit down. The DEA hit my place of business this morning. About a hundred cops looking for me. You two haven't been talking, right? Picked up my whole crew, top to bottom. Everybody except Gonzo. That's weird, right? I mean, don't you think that that's weird?"
Walter,That's weird. Yes. Unusual.
Tuco,"Unusual. Last two days, I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone. He's been acting all pouty on account of No Doze. Explain to me, how is it my fault that that little bitch did not know his place? I saw this coming. I can see the future, you know? It's this gift that I have deep inside my head. I knew last night they were going to come and try and bust me. Gonzo went and snitched to the cops! That lousy son of a bitch! I trusted him like a brother! I was good to him! I was good! I see Gonzo, I'm going to gut him, I'm going to skin him, and I'm going to stuff his hide for a heavy bag, and every time I hit him, it's going to be like a lesson to myself! You never, never trust the people that you love!"
Jesse,"So, you plan to ice Gonzo, like, future tense?"
Tuco,What?
Walter,"You're saying that Gonzo is currently operating as a police informant, as far as you know? I'm very sorry to hear that. That's disappointing."
Jesse,"I'd waste him, too, yo."
Tuco,Shut up.
Jesse,Okay.
Tuco,They're out there looking for me right now. They got ghetto birds and black ops. I need to get high. I need to get good and high. What's with this gak? It smells like head cheese.
Jesse,"It's k*ller. Yeah, seriously."
Tuco,"So, I was thinking last night. I came up with this great idea. Mexico."
Walter,Mexico?
Tuco,"We'll disappear way out in the jungle. We'll set you up in a superlab. We'll do nothing but cook 24-7. And no federales are going to mess with us, because I got my people there. Connections. We're going to make beaucoup bucks, Heisenberg."
Walter,I have a wife and family.
Tuco,So what? You'll get another one.
Walter,"I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I can't just uproot my life like that."
Jesse,"Yeah, man. I mean, me, neither."
Tuco,Who's talking to you?
Jesse,"You need me, man, 'cause I cooked that scante in your hands. I'll tell you something, yo. You never tried nothing like it. Stink or no stink, one bump, you'll be flying high for days. It's a new product him and I have been working on. Careful when you hit it. It kicks like a 12-gauge when it comes on. It's got a secret ingredient."
Tuco,What secret ingredient?
Jesse,Chili powder.
Tuco,"I hate chili powder. This blue magic, this is money. You keep cooking this, Heisenberg. We're going to rewrite history with this. All right! Time to clean the menudo out from between your ears!"
Walter,"No, I need him, Tuco. I need him very, very badly. He's my partner. And if he doesn't go, I don't go."
Tuco,"I'll tell you this, my cousins are driving up here right now to smuggle us back down, and they're going to be here by sunset, and you're going to be on that truck, or you're going to be dead! And you, you better hope they got room in the trunk."
Skyler,Where are you going?
Walter Jr,Louis is taking me to the train station. We'll put these up.
Skyler,"No, no, honey. No, I'll do it."
Marie,"He wants to help, let him help. I mean, how long has it been since you've slept?"
Hank,"Yeah, she's right, Sky. Why don't you lay down a while? For Christ sake, you got a bun in the oven."
Walter Jr,I got my cell if you need me.
Skyler,"Bye, sweetie."
Walter Jr,I'll see you later.
Skyler,All right.
Walter Jr,Bye.
Marie,"Actually, I think the very fact they haven't found him yet bodes well. Well, I mean, if he, you know. Somebody would've smelled something by now."
Skyler,"There's got to be something, some detail that we haven't picked up on."
Marie,What about the second cell phone?
Hank,"Aw, Jesus."
Marie,"We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank."
Skyler,Okay. What are you talking about?
Hank,"The call you said Walt got before he disappeared, there's no record of it with the phone company. No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing."
Skyler,But his phone rang. I heard it.
Hank,"Well, all right. Well, then, if that's the case, he must have a second phone."
Skyler,Why? What sense would there be in that?
Hank,All right. Okay. I'm not here to argue with you.
Skyler,"No, Hank. You can't just bring up ""secret cell phone"" and then drop it. What does it mean?"
Hank,"I don't know, Sky. What do you want me to say? It means Walt has a secret. Everyone's got one from somebody, big or little."
Skyler,"""Everyone."""
Marie,"Skyler, come on. He kept cancer from you for weeks."
Skyler,"Then, let's assume there is a second cell phone. So, what? Is he having an affair?"
Marie,Walt? Please. What about the marijuana?
Skyler,He's not on pot anymore.
Marie,"Says who? Him? Chemotherapy and marijuana go together like apple pie and Chevrolet. Maybe he's addicted to the pot, and he owes his drug dealer a lot of money."
Skyler,You don't get hooked on pot like that.
Marie,How do you know? You didn't even know he had a second cell phone. You have to question this drug dealer person. He may know something.
Hank,"Well, I'm telling you, we're grasping at straws here."
Marie,Then grasp.
Hank,Excuse me. Ma'am? Hi. I'm looking for Jesse. He around?
Mrs. Pinkman,No. I'm afraid not. Why?
Hank,"I'm sorry. Hank Schrader. I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse about my brother-in-law, Walter White. He taught your son chemistry in high school."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Oh, Mr. White. Yes, I remember him. That was a long time ago."
Hank,"Yes, ma'am. It's my understanding that he and Jesse, they've stayed in touch."
Mrs. Pinkman,Really? Mr. White must've seen some potential in Jesse. He really tried to motivate him. He was one of the few teachers who cared.
Hank,"Yeah, Walt's that way. He's a good man."
Mrs. Pinkman,I'm so sorry to hear about his illness. Please pass along our best wishes.
Hank,"I certainly will, as soon as he turns up. He's missing, actually. Just kind of walked off or...anyway, which is why I'm going around trying to think of anyone who knows him, even slightly."
Mrs. Pinkman,That's terrible. Anything we can do to help?
Hank,"Well, if you could put me in touch with your son. Like I said, we're kind of desperate for leads. Jesse's not answering either phone number I have for him, and no one seems to be home at his house."
Mrs. Pinkman,And why do you think my son and Mr. White would be in touch?
Hank,I don't necessarily. I just...
Mrs. Pinkman,Are you with the police?
Hank,"No, ma'am. Not at all. I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Oh, my God. Is my son in trouble?"
Hank,"I have absolutely no reason to think that, no."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Do I need to get a lawyer? You know, you don't seem very forthright about this, coming here and asking questions about my son."
Hank,"Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you, I'm not here on official capacity. I do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong. I just want to find my brother-in-law. His wife is worried sick, and she's got a baby on the way."
Mrs. Pinkman,"I'm sorry. I would like to help you, but I have not seen my son in over a month. I don't expect to see him anytime soon."
Hank,"Well, thanks for your time. If you could tell me one more thing. Is Jesse still driving the, uh, '89 Chevy Monte Carlo, as far as you know?"
Mrs. Pinkman,If he had spent half as much time and money on his education as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car.
Hank,"Lowrider, huh?"
Hank,"Nah, nothing yet. Listen, do me a solid and check out a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo registered to a one Jesse Pinkman. Specifically? I want to know if the car's got LoJack. It's one of those jackoff lowriders. It's got a good sh*t that there is. If so, can you go ahead and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.
Scene  Tuco’s House"
Walter,Chili powder. Did I not already tell you how moronic that was?
Jesse,"Whatever, man. At least I tried something. It almost worked, too. How's about you leaving my g*n? First you boost it, then you leave it in your house. My g*n."
Walter,How was I supposed to know you were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?
Jesse,"Well, at least he wants you alive. Hey, I don't get it. If Tuco didn't k*ll Gonzo, then who did?"
Walter,"I don't know. I don't know. Does it really matter? If he finds out that Gonzo is dead and not a police informant, who does he automatically blame? Us. We need a plan. Think, think."
Jesse,"Let's just bum-rush him, man. You know, you crack him over the head with something, and I'll go for his g*n."
Walter,"""Crack him over the head with something?’”"
Jesse,"And you got the C-bomb, man. You're as good as checked out already. You should be, like, all sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo."
Walter,"Oh, so my life is not the priority here, because I'm going to be dead soon anyway. That's your point? We gotta get him to take this."
Jesse,He don't much like the taste of chili P. That much has been established. So unless you can convince him to booty bump...
Tuco,"Eat. We've got a long ride ahead of us. Go and sit. You're looking a little weak, Heisenberg. I don't want you to go belly up before we get there. Take it easy, tio. I will feed you. I eat first. That's the deal. What? I get it, I get it, I get it. You greedy old b*st*rd. I tell you, Heisenberg. Old people. You feed them, huh? You put them in a really nice crib in the country, and yet they gotta steal the food off your plate. You better eat every bite of that. What did you do that for? God!"
Tuco,"Look. Lookit. There's nothing left. What? What do you want? Don't even tell me that you're hungry. Don't go there. Are you mad-dogging them, tio? What, you don't like them? One ding. That means ""yes."" Tio don't like you. Why don't you like them, tio? You don't trust them? Why don't you trust them, tio?"
Walter,"Tuco, come on. I mean, he's, there's clearly some dementia. He's not lucid."
Tuco,"Did they do something to you, tio? Something that you don't like? What did they do to you? What did you do to my tio?"
Walter,Nothing.
Tuco,Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
Walter,"I don't know. I swear. I don't know. Maybe, I did change the channel on his TV, but that's it."
Jesse,"Yeah, that’s it, while you were cooking, he was watching one of those those ""telenovels"" with all those ripe honeys on it? He was really into it. I told you not to change the channel, man! Dude needs his eye candy. That's it."
Tuco,"Is that it, tio? Is that it, tio? Did they change your mamitas? What are you telling me, tio? Are they punking me?"
Jesse,"No, man."
Tuco,Come here! Shut up!
Jesse,"Please, no! Please, no! No, God! I don't want to die!"
Tuco,"Tell me what you did, Walter!"
Jesse,Jesus! I don't want to die!
Tuco,Tell me what you did!
Walter,"We tried to poison you. We tried to poison you, because you're an insane, degenerate piece of filth, and you deserve to die."
Jesse,Who's the bitch now?
Walter,"Let him bleed. The keys! Oh, my God. The cousins?"
Jesse,What the hell's going on?
Hank,"Jesse Pinkman. You're a hard man to find. Aw, shit. Easy."
Walter,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hank."
Jesse,Who?
Walter,Hank.
Jesse,What?
Walter,"Oh, my God."
Jesse,What?
Walter,"Oh, my God."
Jesse,What are you doing?
Jesse,"It's a bold plan, Mr. White. You sure this is the way to go?"
Skyler,What does he remember?
Doctor,Not a whole lot. He came in dehydrated and disoriented but once we gave him fluids he stabilized pretty quickly.
Skyler,"But, I mean he knows where he is?"
Doctor,"Yes, absolutely. It's only the last day or so that seems to be missing. Go on in, he's probably awake."
Walter,My God. I'm so sorry. Come here.
Walter Jr,"You know who I am, right?"
Walter,"Yes, son. I know who you are. Come here, give your old man a hug. It's so good to see you."
Skyler,How do you feel?
Walter,"Better. I feel like myself. Really, I mean, the last couple days are missing, but other than that, I feel fine."
Skyler,"My God, Walt."
Walter,What a day this has been?
Walter Jr,"So, Uncle Hank. He was in a shoot-out."
Walter,A shoot-out?
Walter Jr,He k*lled some guy. Some big drug dealer. Uncle Hank wasted him.
Walter,My God. Is he all right?
Skyler,Absolutely fine.
Walter,But where did this happen? How could he be...
Skyler,"Walt, everything's okay. We're all okay."
Skyler,And no idea what caused it?
Dr. Delcavoli,"But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so."
Skyler,But what could it be? Did they give you a worst-case scenario?
Dr. Delcavoli,"I really, there's no point in getting ahead of ourselves."
Marie,"Which supermarket? Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain? Don't get me wrong. I think it's just great that he's back and he's feeling better. I just, I mean, naked? He was naked naked. In a supermarket. It wasn't Whole Foods, was it? In any case, I'm gonna get over there as soon as I can."
Skyler,"Don't worry about it right now, Marie. How's Hank?"
Marie,"I ran over here and I got to see him all of 30 seconds before they yanked him away. You'd think today of all days, they'd let him go home on time."
Skyler,But how is he? Really?
Marie,"He's indestructible, you know that."
Hank,"I identified myself and told the suspect to show his hands, turn and face me. At this point, I identified the suspect as Mr. Salamanca and observed what appeared to be a g*nsh*t wound in his midsection."
Ramey,He was sh*t previous to your arrival?
Hank,"Yes, sir. Again I instructed him to show his hands. Mr. Salamanca lunged toward the vehicle and fired on me with what I ascertained to be an M16 as*ault r*fle. I returned fire and sought cover as Mr. Salamanca proceeded to engage me. When he paused to reload I was able to take an effective sh*t."
Ramey,"Agent Schrader, what were you doing in a sh**ting fight on your own, with no backup?"
Hank,Mr. Salamanca's presence was not something I'd anticipated. I was tending to another matter.
Ramey,What other matter?
Hank,An unrelated family matter.
Merkert,Searching for your brother-in-law as I understand.
Ramey,Your brother-in-law?
Hank,"Yes, sir. He's since been found. He's fine. The whole thing was a misunderstanding. But at the time, he'd been missing for several hours and, since he's in poor health, the whole family was concerned. I was talking to his friends and acquaintances trying to get a fix on his whereabouts. The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged to a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman. I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car when I came across Mr. Salamanca."
Merkert,And what about this Pinkman? What was his car doing at the crime scene? Have you run him down yet?
Hank,"Not yet, but we're working on it."
Badger,"Man, they're like Jehovah's witnesses. They don't give up. I don't get it. Why don't they just kick your door down?"
Jesse,They need probable cause.
Badger,"""Probable cause?"" Yo, what'd you do? Rob a bank?"
Jesse,"I told you, this is serious shit. I'm like an outlaw. Let's do this."
Badger,"Holy christ! You're Willy Wonka! You are Willy Wonka, and I got the golden ticket! Put me on your magical boat, man! Sail me down your chocolatey river of meth! So, where you keep the pseudo?"
Jesse,"It's a P2P cook. That barrel? Aqueous methylamine. With that, you don't need pseudo. Come on, help me out, man!"
Badger,"No pseudo? Come to me, beautiful baby. I'm gonna be so good to you."
Jesse,"Just take this, here."
Badger,But I can't just let you break this down. That'd be sacrilege!
Jesse,"I told you, that's why we're here. You saw the cops! All right?"
Badger,Sure. But couldn't we just cook one quick batch? For the road?
Jesse,"No, forget it, all right? This stuff has to go, like, now."
Badger,"You owe me! We're cool and all, but I ain't forgetting you just left me stranded."
Jesse,"God, Badger! Don't mess with me! Got it?"
Badger,I got it.
Jesse,"My God. Okay, that's all of it."
Badger,This is a bad choice.
Jesse,You sure about this guy?
Badger,"He's totally, totally cool. He's my cousin."
Jesse,"Yo, what'd we say, 500?"
Clovis,"We didn't say, and it's 1,000."
Jesse,"$1,000? C'mon, where you towing it, man, Seattle?"
Clovis,"It ain't the miles, it's the cargo."
Jesse,"Dude, all I got on me is $560."
Badger,You know what? Clovis! He'll pay you the rest later. He's totally good for it! Jesse's a stand-up dude.
Clovis,"That right? You a ""stand-up dude?"""
Jesse,"Yeah, I am. I will get you the other $500."
Clovis,"$500 more. Your word's bond, right?"
Jesse,Right.
Badger,"I saved your skinny ass, yo. I totally vouched for you."
Jesse,"What are you doing now, exactly?"
Badger,"I'm giving you, like, two hours and then I'm calling on a pay phone, not a cell phone."
Jesse,You're not using your own name.
Badger,"I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do, like, what you said, but why do you gotta go and do this?"
Jesse,They need probable cause. I'm giving it to them.
Doctor,What's the last thing you remember?
Walter,I was driving home. I think.
Skyler,"Do you remember coming home? You came in, and I asked why you were out of breath? You don't remember talking to me when I was in the bathtub?"
Walter,"No, I'm sorry, I don't."
Doctor,Nothing else? No fleeting images?
Walter,"I don't know. I was walking down some road or highway with a lot of headlights, and I remember feeling fear. Thank you."
Dr. Delcavoli,There's definitely some good news here. The MRI shows no metastases.
Skyler,Meaning the cancer hasn't spread to the brain?
Dr. Delcavoli,"Yeah, we're looking really good."
Skyler,"Thank God. So, what was it, then?"
Nurse,"Well, there's no sign of stroke or seizure. And considering your condition, the blood panel looks good."
Skyler,Then what are we talking about? What happened?
Dr. Delcavoli,"As of right now, we really can't say."
Walter,"Forgive me. Granted, this is not my field, but isn't it possible that this had something to do with all the prescriptions I've been taking? There's the antiemetic, the antitussive, the this, the that, not to mention the chemo itself. And being off all of them for the past few days, I have to say, I'm feeling much better."
Skyler,"And when we pick up these medications, the information sheets are as long as your arm. I mean, it's page after page of side effects and and warnings."
Walter,"Right, exactly. Could it be that simple?"
Dr. Delcavoli,"We'll take another look at that, sure. Walt, I understand that you've been kind of stressed out lately."
Walter,"Stressed out? No, I don't think I'm..."
Skyler,"Walt, please. ""Stressed out"" is putting it mildly."
Walter,"I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately, but as I've said, I'm feeling much better. Shouldn't we be talking about when I can get out of here?"
Dr. Delcavoli,That may still be a ways down the road.
Walter,"""A ways down the road?"""
Dr. Delcavoli,"Actually, I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation."
Walter,"Now, is that absolutely necessary?"
Dr. Delcavoli,Nobody likes being in the hospital. I get that. But until we know what caused this incident we can't be certain it won't recur.
Jesse,That your last hit? Finish it quick.
Agent,"Get on your stomach now! Get over, roll. Do it now!"
Jesse,"I'm going, I'm going. What's going on? What'd I do?"
Hank,"Jesse Pinkman, I presume."
Jesse,"What, man?"
Hank,Tell me again.
Jesse,"Again? What's there to tell, okay? Her and I were partying, that's it."
Hank,Since Saturday night? Partying for three days straight. Just bumping uglies and smoking that crystal you got from your pal Tuco?
Jesse,"Taco? I don't know any Taco, and I damn sure didn't say anything about no crystal."
Hank,"Three days, you must have got hungry."
Jesse,"Yeah, I guess."
Hank,"You order take-out? Yeah, where from? You get yourself a little of that Moo goo gai pan from that chink place around the corner?"
Jesse,"No, no, we didn't. We got stuff from the vending machine. You know, Funyuns. I had a Hot Pocket."
Hank,Funyuns and Hot Pockets? And you didn't notice your car was gone?
Jesse,"No, not until you guys went and busted down the door. Now who's gonna pay for that? Management's gonna be on my ass for sure."
Hank,Why didn't you answer your cell phone?
Jesse,It was in my car.
Hank,That right?
Jesse,Yeah.
Hank,"We found your car, but your phone wasn't in it."
Jesse,You found my car? You found my car? Awesome! DEA all the way!
Hank,"Since we're talking about missing property, did you leave anything else in the car?"
Jesse,Like what?
Hank,"Like what, like, like this?"
Jesse,That's not mine.
Hank,"That's not yours? Says it's not his, Gomie. Gee, I really thought this might be yours."
Jesse,I wish.
Steve,Unclaimed drug money. Nice.
Hank,"You know what we got here, Gomie, don't ya? That's a new interdiction van right there. Definitely some new softball jerseys, 'cause we need 'em. Good thing Tuco's already dead. I lost this kind of money, I'd wanna k*ll myself. So, who's your chief, li'l injun?"
Jesse,What? What does that even mean?
Hank,"It means I think your story's bullshit. I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was. I think your car was there 'cause you were there. Tuco had a b*llet in him when I got there, and I think you know something about that, too."
Jesse,"So, what are you saying? I sh*t someone? With, like, a g*n?"
Hank,You? No. Only sh**ting you do is into a kleenex. But I think you know the badass who did.
Jesse,"Look, I was partying with Wendy."
Hank,"Funyuns and boom-boom. I don't think so. Tell you what, we're gonna, go talk to that skinny, yeast factory of a girlfriend you got. And you know what? I got a feeling she's gonna, you know, roll on you. Don't go nowhere."
Wendy,"Where's my root beer? Come on! I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar. I got medical issues."
Hank,"Medical issues? Like what kind of medical issues? You got pen1s withdrawal? You got ""Schlongus interruptus?” Wendy, listen, talk to me, and you get a root beer and a tinkle. Now tell me the last three days."
Wendy,"I told you, we were shacked up since Saturday."
Hank,"Neither of you left the room? Not even for a little, little minute? Not even for a second?"
Wendy,"For a second? I dunno, maybe."
Hank,"Maybe? Did Jesse leave the room? He did, didn't he? Wendy, you can do it. You can do it, Wendy. You know you wanna go back to giving windys, Wendy."
Wendy,It's you. I know you. You're the one in the black truck. You wanted me to do that kid.
Steve,What?
Wendy,The kid with the crutches. The football player.
Hank,How about we stay on topic?
Wendy,"Look, Jesse came over to the palace at eleven o'clock Saturday night. We were together the whole time, and he never left the room. And that's all I'm saying about that. Now, come on. Where's my root beer?"
Steve,"You wanted her to bang a football player, you pervert?"
Hank,"It's a long story, Gomie."
Steve,"I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it, but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose."
Hank,Not yet. I got one more sh*t at that little skid mark.
Psychiatrist,And how are you sleeping?
Walter,Fine. Most nights. Good.
Psychiatrist,"Have you noticed any recurring thoughts or images, things you can't get out of your head? How about feelings of guilt or persecution?"
Walter,"No, look, Doctor. I don't mean to be rude, but where is this going, exactly?"
Psychiatrist,"We're starting a process, Walt, an ongoing process. Do you prefer Walt or Walter?"
Walter,Ongoing for how long?
Psychiatrist,"I just met you, it's hard to say. We could be talking about days, weeks, months."
Walter,"Look, Doctor, I feel fine, really. Now, if this is truly necessary, can't I continue as an outpatient?"
Psychiatrist,"A fugue state is a very serious event. What if you were to disassociate while driving? What if you were to get into a situation where you could be sh*t by the police? You understand, we can't allow you to leave until we're certain what happened was a non-recurring event. Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this."
Walter,Would you tell me about patient confidentiality?
Psychiatrist,"It's very straightforward. Without your permission, I can't disclose anything you tell me to anyone."
Walter,What about my family?
Psychiatrist,"Not your family, not to the police. Not to anyone. The only exception would be if you threatened to k*ll someone. Then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person."
Walter,"And you, as a medical practitioner, you abide by these strictures."
Psychiatrist,Absolutely.
Walter,"All right. There was no fugue state. I remember everything. The truth is, I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house. I just had to get out. And so I left. I didn't think about it. I just did it. I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked. I got as far as Gallup, and then it was just time to come home."
Psychiatrist,"So, being found naked in a supermarket, that was your way of giving credibility to a lie? Of avoiding questions about your disappearance? Why run away? What did you feel you had to run from?"
Walter,"Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant with a baby we didn't intend. My 15-year-old son has cerebral palsy. I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher. When I can work, I make $43,700 per year. I have watched all of my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable, and within 18 months, I will be dead. And you ask why I ran?"
Hank,"Gomie, you wanna do the honors?"
Steve,"Buenas tardes, señor Salamanca. ¿Entiendes en inglés?"
Hank,What's that mean?
Nurse,"That means ""yes."" ""Yes"" is a bell, ""no"" is no bell."
Jesse,"Come on, this is bullshit! Look at this dude. He doesn't even know what planet he's living on."
Steve,"Señor, are we on the planet Mars? Are we on the planet Saturn? Are we on the planet Earth? Señor, is today Friday? Is today Monday? Is today Tuesday?"
Hank,Seems like he's all there. Let's go for it.
Steve,Was this man at your house yesterday? Was this man at your house yesterday?
Hank,"This guy right here, he was at your house, right? Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco?"
Steve,Are you scared of this man?
Hank,"Nah, he's not scared. Come on, granddad. Don't you want to help us out?"
Steve,"Oh, man."
Hank,I guess that's a no.
Steve,"I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG. Kept his mouth shut for 17 years in San Quentin. Stroke or no stroke, old school g*ngb*ng Mexicans don't help the Feds."
Hank,All right already. It was worth a try at least.
Steve,We gotta kick Pinkman loose. It's all right. He's nobody anyway.
Hank,"What, you telling me you buy that lame-ass story of his?"
Steve,"I buy that lame-ass story more than I buy he had anything to do with sh**ting Tuco, man."
Jesse,"Dad? Hey, Dad. Can you hear me? I'm fine. I'm, uh, what's She did? No, I didn't get any messages. You know, actually I lost my phone, and I've been too busy to get a new one. I've been busy as sh...  Totally productive. Hey, you know what? I'm actually zeroing in on a job. Data entry, like we talked about. I'm totally amped. Could you give me a ride? I'm actually, I'm downtown and my car's in the...  No, that's cool. I will call you later when you have some...I get it. I get it. Thanks. So, what are you doing now?"
Wendy,Waffle House?
Jesse,Waffle House is good.
Walter,Pay phone?
Jesse,"Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere, nobody followed. How'd it go?"
Walter,Okay. You?
Jesse,"They sweated me plenty, but they finally cut me loose. So you getting out of there?"
Walter,"Tomorrow. So, who came for you? The DEA? What did they ask you?"
Jesse,"That's the thing, you know. Your scumbag brother-in-law took my rainy day fund."
Walter,Your what? What is that?
Jesse,"My rainy day fund, $68,000, okay? Cueball son of a bitch laughed in my face. Now I got like $80 to my name."
Walter,"Wait, wait. What does he know? Does he know it's your money?"
Jesse,"No, man, he doesn't know shit, okay? The plan worked. They bought it. I got bills due, man. I'm screwed."
Walter,Did he mention my name?
Jesse,"No, thanks for caring."
Walter,What about the basement?
Jesse,It's clean.
Walter,And the RV?
Jesse,Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.
Walter,Can he get it running again?
Jesse,Why?
Walter,So we can cook.
Jesse,So you still wanna cook? Seriously?
Walter,"What's changed, Jesse?"
Walter,"737,000. 21 pounds, minus cash on hand...cash on hand."
Skyler,"Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?"
Walter Jr,"No, I was awake."
Skyler,Want some cornflakes?
Walter Jr,Sure.
Skyler,You okay?
Steve,Southwest Aniline? Again? What's this?
Hank,It's the blue meth we found up by your late homie.
Steve,"Tuco wasn't my homie, anymore than Charlie Manson was yours."
Hank,"Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style."
Steve,"P2P, huh? So what are you thinking? The two stooges over here cooked it?"
Hank,Lab said that blue meth's the purest they've seen. At least since this.
Steve,Krazy-8.
Hank,"Yeah. Krazy-8, Tuco...Somehow, some way, it's all connected. A simple explanation, only I'm not seeing it. And it's making my head hurt."
Steve,That's 'cause you're working that ugly melon too hard. It's dead around here. Let's go get a couple of beers.
Hank,It's 11 in the morning.
Steve,I'm buying.
Hank,"You're buying? Holy crap. What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?"
Everyone,Surprise!
Hank,"You sneaky b*st*rd, you!"
Merkert,Very nice work.
Hank,"Thank you, sir. What's this? Look at that, I love it!"
Steve,They got the gut right.
Hank,"Thanks, man. Thank you."
Steve,We all got you a little something. This is from all of us.
Hank,"You shouldn't have. You sick, sick puppies. I love it!"
Walter Jr,You going to finish your apple juice?
Walter,"No thanks, buddy. You take it."
Walter Jr,You're supposed to drink it. The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.
Walter,But I'm not thirsty.
Walter Jr,Dad. Drink it.
Hank,"Better late than never, huh? How you doing, buddy? You all right? I see the Mark of the Beast there, huh?"
Walter,Marie stopped by this morning. They really cheer the place up.
Hank,"I ran into Sky downstairs. They're rounding up a wheelchair for you, you free-loading b*st*rd!"
Walter Jr,So tell us about the shoot-out.
Hank,"You know, just doing my job. Whole thing was over in about five seconds. Say, Walt, you know, how are you?"
Walter,"I'm okay. Really, I'm feeling fine. The doctor is calling it an ""isolated episode of transient global amnesia."""
Hank,Damn.
Walter,Which means non-recurring.
Hank,"Non-recurring. That sounds good. Sounds real good. I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back. You really gave us a scare."
Walter,"Listen, Hank. I don't know what to say. You going out there looking for me put you in danger, and I'm so sorry, sorry doesn't even cut it. Not nearly."
Hank,"Is that what you're worried about? Forget it. At the office, they're treating me like I'm Elliot Ness, okay? They threw me a party, the gals baked me a chocolate-chip cake like you wouldn't believe, okay? You ought to disappear more often. Just kidding. Don't do that. Hey, look. Look what they gave me."
Walter Jr,What is it?
Hank,"That, gentlemen, is the grill of the guy I sh*t."
Walter Jr,His grill?
Hank,"Yeah, it kind of goes over the front teeth like that, you know? Sort of a fashion statement, I guess. Certain folks are attracted to shiny things."
Walter Jr,"Wow, cool."
Walter,I can't tell you how good it feels to be home.
Skyler,I'll get these in the wash.
Walter,"Say, honey, I was just thinking about going out to 7-11. Do you need anything? Big Gulp? Slim Jim? Skyler, listen to me. This will not happen again, okay? I won't let it. I'm still here. I'm me. And we're gonna be okay."
Skyler,Do you have a second cell phone?
Walter,A second cell phone?
Skyler,"The night you disappeared, you came in when I was taking a bath, and you were very upset. It was like something terrible had happened. And then your cell phone rang. I saw you check the number, and then you got up and just disappeared. And when Hank checked your phone records, there was no call. No call on the phone I know about."
Walter,That is odd. I don't remember any of that. But one thing I am sure of is that I don't have a second cell phone.
Homeless Man,"Captain America. What's up, brother?"
Jesse,"Hey, bro."
Jesse,This is stupid.
Walter,You got a better idea?
Jesse,"Okay, fine. Whatever. So when do we, you know?"
Walter,"We don't, for now. No cooking until things settle down."
Jesse,Settle down? I thought you're the one that said nothing's changed.
Walter,"Look, I just put my family through an ordeal that they're just now starting to accept, okay? I can't...ah, that's too expensive. Look, I can't leave my house for more than 20 minutes without my wife worrying. I need time to mend fences."
Jesse,"So while you're fixing fences, what about me, huh? Your A-hole brother-in-law took all my money."
Walter,That's $600.
Jesse,What about the rest?
Walter,Rest of what?
Jesse,"Half your money's mine. You know, 50/50 partners. That's your business motto."
Walter,"Meaning what, exactly? That I suffer for your carelessness?"
Jesse,"You're the one who wanted to work with Tuco. If it weren't for that, none of this would've happened."
Walter,"Just be cool. We'll talk about this later, okay? As for now, no contact. Understood? Where are you going? I leave first."
Skyler,Walt?
Walter,In the kitchen.
Walter Jr,I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.
Walter,"Hilarious, Groucho. Go on, grab a seat. Juice is on the table. Good morning, honey."
Walter Jr,"Hey, Mom. Dad's cooking breakfast.
Walter  But don't worry. I'm also doing all the dishes. Nice? Follow me. There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice, which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of. But considering all the polyphenols and the albuminoids, can't hurt."
Skyler,You didn't have to do this.
Walter,I wanted to. Grapefruit juice?
Walter Jr,"Yes, please. Thanks."
Walter,There you go. Honey?
Skyler,"I'll stick with orange, thank you."
Walter,"All right. Dig in, dig in. Pancakes are not getting hotter."
Walter,All right. Got one. Steely Dan.
Walter Jr,No.
Walter,"Yes, absolutely. No, in terms of pure musicianship, I would put them up against any current band you could name."
Walter Jr,You wouldn't know any current bands.
Walter,That's besides the point.
Skyler,"Have a good day, honey."
Walter Jr,You too.
Walter,Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
Walter Jr,Whoever they are. Thanks for breakfast.
Walter,"You're welcome. Tell Louis to drive carefully, will you?"
Walter Jr,All right.
Walter,Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is. We have failed as parents.
Skyler,"Come to think of it, I barely know who Boz Scaggs is."
Walter,Stop it.
Skyler,"Give me your plate.
Walter  I'll get it. I'll get it. Hey, listen, in the calendar section, all week long, there's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM. And, you know, probably talking about how to get published and that sort of thing. You know, so, anyway, I thought maybe you might I mean, I'll go with you if you like. And I was thinking about what you asked me the other night. You know, you were wondering if I had a second cell phone. And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot, and I think what you heard was my cell phone alarm going off. I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder to well, remind me to take my medication. And the weird thing is that the alarm sound is almost exactly the same as the regular phone ring, which is really a poor design, if you ask me. But I think that was probably it. I tried to go in and change it to a different sound, other than the phone ring, but they over complicate these things. Anyway, it was probably just as well that I lost it. There's got to be a new one on the market by now. You know, if we do this thing at UNM, maybe on the way home, we can stop by, and I can get a new cell phone. Skyler?"
Lawyer,Ready?
Jesse,"Yo, for what might help. Not another intervention."
Lawyer,"Jesse Bruce Pinkman, pursuant to Section 47-8-13 of the New Mexico Real Property Code, you are hereby given notice to vacate the premises listed as 9809 Margo, Albuquerque, 87104."
Jesse,Wait. What? You're kicking me out of my own house?
Mr. Pinkman,It's your aunt Ginny's house.
Jesse,She gave it to me.
Mr. Pinkman,"She never gave it to you, Jesse."
Lawyer,You were allowed residentiary privileges. Your parents have always been the property owners.
Jesse,"Look, we talked about this, okay? I'd sell the house, we'd split it 50/50. That was the deal. What the hell happened?"
Mr. Pinkman,What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.
Jesse,"No, I'm not. What?"
Mrs. Pinkman,"A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse. He came to our front door."
Jesse,"Because I've actually been helping them, which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you, so you're welcome."
Mrs. Pinkman,"I saw your basement. I was worried, so I went over there and I let myself in, and I found your laboratory."
Jesse,You guys have your own key?
Lawyer,"Manufacture of a Schedule II controlled substance is a second-degree felony. Under federal asset seizure, the government can take the entire house."
Jesse,It's not even there anymore. I cleaned it all out.
Mr. Pinkman,"Son, we can't stop you from ruining your life, but you will not drag us down with you."
Lawyer,"Vacate the house in 72 hours. Otherwise, your parents have authorized me to contact the authorities. Is that clear? Do you have any questions for us? Three days, Mr. Pinkman."
Mr. Pinkman,Come on.
Walter,I fixed the garage door.
Skyler,Great.
Walter,One track was bent. That's why it was bouncing. Where were you today?
Skyler,Out.
Walter,Is everything okay?
Skyler,Everything's fine.
Walter,"For what it's worth, I was thinking about going back to those meetings, the cancer support group."
Skyler,I think that's good.
Walter,"Yeah, that's good. You were right on the money about that. It's good to, you know, talk about things."
Skyler,I think that's great.
Mrs. Pinkman,"Jesse. Jesse. Hey, Jesse. You don't answer your phone?"
Jesse,"No, I've just been pretty busy. How'd you...oh, right, you have that key. Hey, listen. So I've been thinking a lot about our conversation we had the other day, and I completely get why Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and..."
Mrs. Pinkman,"It's not just your father, Jesse."
Jesse,"I know. I know. I'm just saying it's a really, really big wake-up call for me, which is why I wanted to talk to you. I've been thinking real seriously about business school, actually, and you can do the whole thing from your computer now, and no, Mom, Mom. Hey, this is good. You know, we're talking, starting a dialogue."
Mrs. Pinkman,"The time for talking has passed, Jesse."
Jesse,"Hey! Hey! What the hell, yo? I thought it was just a wake-up call."
Mrs. Pinkman,"We are putting it in storage. When you decide to grow up, you can have it back."
Jesse,"Why don't you grow up, Mom? Ginny wanted me here. I was the one who took care of her. I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day. I earned this!"
Mrs. Pinkman,You did not make her lunch every day.
Jesse,"What did you do, huh? She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?"
Mrs. Pinkman,Don't start with me.
Jesse,"Now what, you've decided to, I don't know, make your eldest son homeless? Wow! Great family, Mom!"
Mrs. Pinkman,Why are you like this? Why? You have two sets of keys and the padlock to the garage. Leave them on the kitchen counter when you leave.
Jesse,"No, Mom! Mom! Where am I supposed to go?"
Mrs. Pinkman,"I don't know, sweetheart. But please turn your life around."
Jesse,"Yeah, this is gonna help big time with that! Bitch!"
Louis,"Oh, hey, Mr. White."
Walter,That's the way. Don't just sit out there honking. Come in and say hello. We've got omelets. You want an omelet?
Louis,"No, I'm good."
Walter,"New Mexican Christmas style, red and green chilies."
Louis,"No. Thank you, though. Flynn and me gotta get going."
Walter,Who's Flynn?
Louis,Flynn. He's your...
Walter,Flynn?
Walter Jr,"Yeah, so?"
Walter,So? Nothing.
Walter Jr,You ready?
Walter,Like it.
Louis,"Bye, Mr. White."
Walter,"Flynn? You know about this Flynn thing? As in what, Errol?"
Skyler,I don't know. It's what he likes to be called these days.
Walter,What's wrong with Walter Jr?
Skyler,Don't take it personally. He wants his own identity.
Walter,You think he told Louis about me? About the blackout?
Skyler,"Louis is his friend, Walt, and your disappearance upset him."
Walter,I made omelets.
Skyler,"I'm going out, but thanks, though."
Walter,Where are you going?
Skyler,"Can you get the phone, please?"
Walter,Yeah. Absolutely. White residence.
Jesse,"Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?"
Walter,"What part of ""no contact"" didn't you understand?"
Jesse,I know but there's a problem.
Walter,"I don't care. We agreed. No amount of pay-per-view channels is gonna make any difference. Honey, we're happy with our cable provider, right? We're happy. Skyler, where are you going? Can you at least tell me that?"
Skyler,"Out. Should probably get that, Walt. I'll be back in a few hours."
Walter,What?
Jesse,"Yo, I get I shouldn't call, but I'm in a situation over here, and I need my money."
Walter,I just gave you $600.
Jesse,"Yeah, and thanks, Daddy Warbucks, but that was before my housing situation went completely testicular on me, okay?"
Walter,"You smoked the entire 600, didn't you."
Jesse,What? No!
Walter,Jesse.
Jesse,No!
Walter,"Look, Jesse, your problems are just that. Your problems. No contact. Do not call here ever. When the moment is right, I will call."
Jesse,"Mr. White, you're not listening! They're kicking me out of my house!"
Walter,You son of a bitch.
Jesse,"Ow, son of a bitch! Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, man! Hey, guy! You forgot something! You forgot your ice trays! You're gonna need the ice trays! Forgot something here! Take this!"
Jesse,"(singing) Black is the color but beauty is the game. The beasties come to get me but I don’t feel the pain. Fallacies, fallacies, fallacies, fallacies, fallacies, fallacies, fallacies, fallacies!"
Paul,"Hold on, buddy."
Jesse,"Yo, we should get TwaughtHammer up and running again, yo. I'm serious."
Paul,I know. That sounded tight.
Jesse,"Hey, thanks again, P. I made sure this stock knock exterminator put me on his speed dial. Two nights tops."
Paul,You still staying at your aunt's on Morgo?
Jesse,"Yeah. I'm thinking of moving. Nob Hill, probably."
Paul,"Jesse-matic, living the dream. Okay, buddy, listen. You're gonna eat your carrots?"
Ben,Too hot.
Paul,"No, buddy. Remember? Come on. Yes. Listen, hey, talk to me, man. Are you still having mad relations out there? You can talk to me. I won't hate a player."
Jesse,I can't lie. It's pretty hectic out there female-wise.
Paul,"Damn. I'm hating, man."
Jesse,"See, that's why we need to get the Hammer up and running, you know? Get you out of the house."
Paul,How awesome would that be? Come on. Look. What? I cut all the green parts off like you. Just eat them. Please?
Jesse,"We should do this, you know? Track down Chivo and Anthony and demo up. Get back in the scene."
Paul,"I'm sorry, man. Just hold on one second, all right? Okay, listen. How about you take a bite of your sandwich, and then you take...Mommy's home! Hi."
Wife,Hello.
Paul,"Hey, honey, you remember Jesse Pinkman? His house is getting bug bombed, and I said he could crash a few nights."
Wife,"Hey, Jesse."
Jesse,Hey.
Wife,"Paul, could you help me in the bedroom with these?"
Paul,Sure.
Jesse,"Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too."
Wife,"Hey, Ben, I think it's someone's nap time. Come on."
Paul,"Man, dude, you're gonna k*ll me. I totally spaced that the in-laws are crashing this weekend. You got other people to call?"
Jesse,"No, that's cool. I got tons of people. Yo, in-laws? Sucks to be you, P."
Paul,"Yeah, I know, huh? Dude, here. See you, man. It's good to see you."
Jesse,"Look, I'm asking to crash three, maybe four nights. I already called Badger, all right? I called everyone. I need a solid here, bro. Yeah, whatever. All right. All right. How about this? What if it's just for tonight? Wait. No, you cannot be serious. You cannot be serious!"
Homeless Man,"Someone took your bike, man. Not cool."
Walter Jr,Morning.
Walter,Morning.
Walter Jr,Where did Mom go?
Walter,Out.
Walter Jr,Where's breakfast?
Walter,Let's go do something.
Walter Jr,Like what?
Walter,Something fun.
Walter,"All right, ready? Let's put it in gear. Is your foot on the...okay. Good."
Walter Jr,Yeah. I got it.
Walter,"Good. Yes. Nice and smooth. Good. Just like that. Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2. Very nice. Okay, let's slow down here to a stop in preparation for a left-hand turn. All right. You might want to go easier on the brake."
Walter Jr,Sorry about that.
Walter,"That's all right. You're doing fine. Much better than last time, huh?"
Walter Jr,Louis has been helping me.
Walter,Has he? Good. Good. Okay. Don't forget the turn indicator. Good. I'll stop talking. You know what you're doing. And let's make that left-hand turn. Nice and smooth. Very nice. Right hand. Good. Good. Okay. Are you using both feet?
Walter Jr,Yeah.
Walter,"No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt. You can't do that. You can't use one foot on each pedal."
Walter Jr,Why not?
Walter,"Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay? All right."
Walter Jr,"Dad, this is way easier."
Walter,"Come on, there's the easy way, and then there's the right way, right? So let's just try it again, right foot only. All right. Okay? Okay, just you don't have to, okay. All right. That's fine. Just that's okay. Just try it again. Here we go. Let's just try it again. Go just a little easier. Good. Great. That was better. See? Right? Better? Right. The gas, the brake, the gas, the brake."
Walter Jr,I can't do this. My legs don't work that way.
Walter,"Your legs are fine. You just have to stick with it. Don't set limits for yourself, Walt. You're all right. We'll get this. I promise. Now let's just try again. All right? All right. Here we go. Well, you don't need to just take off, but all right, here we go. Slow it down just a little bit. All right, we have a turn coming up here, so prepare to apply the brakes. Prepare, Walt, for the brakes. The brakes, the brakes."
Walter Jr,I'm braking!
Walter,You're using both feet again.
Walter Jr,It's not stopping.
Walter,That's the gas. Use the brakes. Brake. That's one way to stop.
Walter Jr,I told you.
Walter,Flynn.
Clovis,"Hands up, assh*le! So help me, I will spread you."
Jesse,"No, please, no, all right? It's me, okay? It's Jesse. All right? Look, this is my RV. You towed it. Your cousin Badger, remember?"
Clovis,What the hell you doing here? You smell like shit.
Jesse,It's a long story.
Clovis,"So I fixed up your felonious rolling laboratory here. $750 for the repair. Make it a grand, counting the toilet, plus the $500 you already owe me, and you're good to drive on out of here to someplace far away, upwind."
Jesse,"Here's the thing. I can't pay you today. But I can pay you this week, all right? $1,750? We'll make it $1,750 for, like interest."
Clovis,I thought your word was your bond.
Jesse,"It totally is. Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment. But I will, soon."
Clovis,Here's my counter-offer. I kick you out. I take payment from your inventory. I know a guy that'll pay a premium for this kind of crap.
Jesse,"All right. 2 grand. Two days, 2 grand. That's totally fair. Just don't take my cook stuff. All right? That's all I got left. Please, all right? I really God, I really need a break here."
Jesse,"Clovis, come on."
Clovis,I don't know. There's a bunch of stuff in there. There's something called methylamine. Me Meth However the hell you pronounce it. Methylamine. I don't know. I banged on it. It sounds pretty full to me. Holy shit. How much?
Walter,Skyler. Louis took Walt to school. I was thinking maybe this would be a good time to talk. I dreamt that I owned an antique bicycle repair shop. In Ireland. Weird.
Skyler,Sounds weird.
Walter,"I wanted to apologize for everything. My desire for privacy. My emotional unavailability. Having cancer doesn't excuse all that. I haven't been a good partner to you, and for that I'm very sorry. I love you. And I love this family. And I just want to make sure that we don't lose contact."
Skyler,Thank you. I agree. Is that it?
Walter,"God. God, how long are you going to do this?"
Skyler,Do what?
Walter,"This. Not talking to me. Going out all day and refusing to tell me where. You are obviously angry with me about something, so let's talk about it. God. I feel like you're upset with me because you think that I'm up to something."
Skyler,Like what?
Walter,"I have no idea, Skyler. What, that I'm having an affair? Is that it? Is that what you think? Is that why you asked me about some other phone? Because you think that I'm being unfaithful?"
Skyler,I don't know.
Walter,So ask me.
Skyler,Why? Would you even tell me?
Walter,"Yes. I would. Of course I would. And no. I'm not. I'm not having an affair, okay? Now, what do I do to prove that to you? Swear an oath? My right hand to God. I'm not having an affair."
Skyler,"I heard you, Walt. You're not having an affair. Congratulations."
Walter,"No, you know what? Congratulations to you, Skyler. Great job. What is this? What do I have to do? I'm trying to talk to you, and you..."
Skyler,"Okay, so talk, Walt! Shut up and say something that isn't complete bullshit. You want to know what you have to do? You have to tell me what's really going on right now. Today. No more excuses. No more apologies. No more of these obvious, desperate breakfasts. You don't want to lose contact with me, Walt? Good. Then tell me. Now."
Walter,Tell you what? What is it you want me to tell you? I don't know. We're not done here. Do you know what I've done for this family?
Jesse,"Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?"
Walter,What is wrong with you? Why are you blue? Jesus.
Jesse,I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts with my parents being greedy kleptomaniac douche bags.
Walter,Are you actually this stupid?
Jesse,"No, look. I know this isn't optimal..."
Walter,"To come to my house and park on my street, driving this vehicle. What the hell is wrong with you? I'm really asking."
Jesse,Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
Walter,"What if Skyler had seen you? What then? What was the plan then, genius?"
Jesse,I don't know.
Walter,You know why you don't know? Because you don't think. That's why. You don't think. You never figured out how to think.
Jesse,"I said I was sorry. I just need my half of the money, and I will go."
Walter,Your half? There is no “your half” of the money! There is only my all of it! Do you understand? Why should I be penalized because of your sloppiness?
Jesse,"Look, that is completely uncool, all right? We agreed, 50/50 partners."
Walter,"Partners in what? What exactly do you do here? I've been meaning to ask because I'm the producer, right? I cook. But from what I can tell, you are just a drug addict. You are a pathetic junkie, too stupid to understand and follow simple rudimentary instructions. Too stupid to..."
Walter,Try not to touch anything. Want some breakfast?
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, we've come a long way, Walt. Here at the end of round one, I'm going to recommend cautious optimism. We'll check back in two months, see how you've responded, reassess, and decide our next move, if any. That's right around the time the baby's due, correct?"
Walter,Yeah.
Dr. Delcavoli,"Well, try to think of this as good timing. You'll start feeling better soon, more like yourself, and your hair should start to come back."
Walter,I kind of gotten used to the old cue ball look.
Dr. Delcavoli,I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
Walter,Right. Aerodynamic.
Dr. Delcavoli,No more confusion?
Walter,Absolutely none.
Dr. Delcavoli,How are you two holding up?
Walter,"Fine. I mean, you know, we're busy, but we're good. Absolutely. It's all good."
Teller,"So, we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?"
Walter,Yes. Direct bill.
Teller,Just need to print it out for you.
Walter,Thank you. I thought we had discussed a cash discount.
Teller,"Absolutely. It's included. Just a reminder, we do have a payment plan available, should you be interested."
Walter,"Oh, yeah. Okay."
Teller,Congratulations.
Walter,Thank you.
Skyler,"Then, what about the MRI? Can you please explain to me the distinction between diagnostic and exploratory? Yeah, but either way, his doctor ordered it. It should be covered. You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate. Well, I'm sorry you couldn't be of more help, too. Bitch."
Walter,Been around someone who smokes?
Skyler,No. The hospital bill came.
Walter,That was fast.
Skyler,"Three-day stay  $13,000 and counting. Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover? I know it's strictly your domain, but..."
Walter,They will. I'm sure they will. I'll handle it.
Merkert,Bring me up to speed on Salamanca.
Hank,Dead.
Merkert,Still?
Hank,Completely.
Merkert,"Okay, then. Well, thanks for stopping by."
Hank,Okay. So things are quiet. Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now.
Merkert,Good.
Hank,Of course that’s not going to last. Waiting to see who rallies the roaches now that his turf's up for grabs.
Merkert,No takers so far?
Hank,"We keep hearing a name. Heisenberg. Lately, pretty much every dime-bagger we come across."
Merkert,Heisenberg?
Hank,"Yeah, I know. Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend. Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding. Anyway, we'll stay on it."
Merkert,"Know why sharks are at the top of the food chain, Hank?"
Hank,'Cause they have three sets of teeth and will take a bite out of anything?
Merkert,Some of those suckers travel thousands of miles in pursuit of their prey.
Hank,"Yeah, I think I heard that."
Merkert,"You, my friend, are a great white. How does Albuquerque Liaison, Tri-state Border Interdiction Task Force sound?"
Hank,Like one hell of a promotion.
Merkert,"As of the 1st, I want you to split your time between here and El Paso."
Hank,"Thank you, sir. Thank you."
Hank,"What you gonna do without me, Gomie?"
Steve,Celebrate. I won't have to look at your ugly mug six days a week.
Hank,"Hey, buddy, I am the brains and the brawn. I'm the whole package."
Steve,I'm glad I didn't just eat.
Agent,I'm surprised his head still fits through the door.
Hank,"Hey, wanna grab lunch?"
Steve,"Hell, yeah. 'Cause you're buying."
Hank,"Done. I'll meet you morons downstairs. Try not to get lost on the way. Schrader. Yeah, hey Ricky. How you doing? Yeah, I'm stoked, too. Yeah, El Paso."
Agent,Here's the man.
Agent,"Hey, congratulations, Hank."
Hank,Thanks.
Jesse,Hey.
Clovis,You got some nerve coming back here. Or you're even dumber than I thought.
Jesse,"Yeah, well, maybe both. Balance for the tow, the repairs, and extra for, you know, damages and stuff to the gate, the toilet. Look, like I said, my word is my bond. What would you charge me to store this here?"
Clovis,A million-five.
Jesse,"Come on, yo."
Clovis,Your sister.
Jesse,"Dawg, I'm serious, all right? I got storage needs. And I got scratch up front. We could, you know, negotiate."
Clovis,500.
Jesse,A month?
Clovis,A week.
Jesse,For real?
Clovis,See ya.
Jesse,Wait. Just hold on. Just chill. Sounds good. Totally doable.
Clovis,Outside.
Jesse,Inside.
Clovis,Forget it.
Jesse,"Man, come on. Your fence is too easy to climb. Inside, padlocked, plus gate privileges."
Clovis,Come again?
Jesse,"Gate, in and out, privileges."
Clovis,Month to month. Cash up front. Inside. And I don't know you. I don't know jack.
Jesse,Yeah. You selling?
Clovis,I'll let you take it for nine Gs.
Jesse,What about that one?
Clovis,"Serious?
Scene  Apartment"
Jesse,"It's Jane, right? Well, Jane, I gotta say, this place is awesome."
Jane,Really? Does it inspire awe?
Jesse,"No. I mean, it's great. Just what I've been looking for. That's what I meant. I had an entire house before, detached and all, but I was just tired of all the lawn care and upkeep and whatnot."
Jane,"Well, the blinds are new. Everything's been painted."
Jesse,Jesus.
Jane,Utilities are included.
Jesse,Stacking. Sweet. You got cable?
Jane,"Already wired. Just call to activate. High speed, whatever."
Jesse,"Bathroom, cool tile. Bedroom. Nice. I'm a fan of the hardwood."
Jane,So? You're interested?
Jesse,Definitely.
Jane,And you're good with NPNS?
Jesse,Sorry. What?
Jane,"In the ad? No smoking, no pets. You want to smoke, you do it outside."
Jesse,It's cool. No worries.
Jane,"The usual drill. I'll need a W-2 or a recent pay stub, current employer, former address, you know, the yadda-yadda. And if it's all copasetic, I'll call."
Jesse,"Look, the thing is I..."
Jane,Unbelievable.
Jesse,I'm currently in-between situations.
Jane,And I'm currently not renting.
Jesse,"I got the money and I'm totally good for it for, like, ever. Come on, yo, can you please, please just help a brother out?"
Jane,"Yo, my dad's not really a ""make exceptions"" kind of guy. Trust me."
Jesse,Your dad?
Jane,"Owns the place. I manage it. Pen on paper, that's what I need. Or go run your game somewhere else."
Jesse,"Dude, I got nowhere else to go. This is it. And I got no game, all right? I just need a chance. Look, my folks, they kicked me out. I'm a disappointment, apparently. Didn't meet their expectations, again. So, you know, now I'm persona non gratis or whatever. But you know what? I'm a good person and I work hard. I will pay you every month and I will pay you on time. I will not mess this up, okay? I swear."
Jane,Rent just went up. A hundred more a month. That's the cash price.
Jesse,You rock. You won't regret this.
Jane,"And, in addition to the first and last, I want two more months. DBAA fee, nonrefundable."
Jesse,Of course. No problem. DBAA. Obviously. What's DBAA?
Jane,"""Don't be an assh*le."""
Jesse,Gotcha.
Jane,I live next door.
Jesse,Really?
Jane,"And don't think for one second you have squatters' rights, because you don't. If you blow this, I want you gone. I know guys that'll have your skinny ass out back by the dumpster faster than you can blink. I'll fill it in. Just sign your name. Which is what, by the way?"
Jesse,It's Jesse. Jesse Jackson.
Jane,Seriously?
Jesse,What?
Marie,What are you doing?
Hank,Beatin' off. What's it look like?
Marie,"That is, in fact, exactly what it looks like to me."
Hank,"Brewing is an art form, Marie. I think you'd appreciate that by now. Christmas, the batch of '06? Come on."
Marie,"So, let me get this straight. You call in sick the day after receiving a long-awaited, career boosting promotion so you can play Oktoberfest in your man cave? I don't get it. Really, I don't."
Hank,"Babe, relax."
Marie,"Please, don't tell me to relax. You know I hate that."
Hank,Right.
Marie,Dave said I should express that.
Hank,"All I'm saying is everything's fine. I can take a day. No big deal. Now, get that sweet ass out of here so I can concentrate."
Jesse,"Okay, so what's the plan?"
Walter,The plan is we cook.
Jesse,Why are we cooking when we can't even move what we cook?
Walter,"Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own? Say if I cooked during the days and you worked the nights."
Jesse,Dude.
Walter,"What? Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it? I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before, but still, what choice do we have?"
Jesse,"First of all, there's no ""we."" You're talking me, solo, busting hump slinging shards. I got profile now. Don't you get that? The DEA 's up my ass. I'm not exposing myself to that level of risk for chump change. No way."
Walter,Then what do you suggest? I don't think either of us are eager to jump into bed with another Tuco.
Jesse,"I got bills, man."
Walter,You've got bills?
Jesse,"Rent, yo. Responsibilities. I've already lost more than I have made, and I am tired of dicking around out here."
Walter,"You want to know how much I've got left? After completing my first round of treatment and financing the world's most expensive alibi? Zero! Zip! Nothing! I've got nothing to show for all of this. Nothing for my family, which, as you might remember, was the damn point! But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option, that leaves us with a total of two choices. We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic or you and I start. You selling whatever you can."
Jesse,There's a third way.
Walter,And what would that be?
Jesse,We got to be Tuco. Cut out the middleman. Run our own game.
Walter,"So you're going to, what? Snort meth off a bowie knife? You gonna beat your homies to death when they diss you?"
Jesse,"Look, I know some guys. All right? I can create a network. We control production and distribution. That way, we stay off the front lines while moving some serious glass. The point here is to make money, right? Sky-high stacks. That's not the point?"
Walter,"No, I am not willing to do that."
Jesse,Who said anything about you?
Walter,I don't vote for this plan. I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown entries into our operation.
Jesse,You don't get to vote.
Walter,"I beg your pardon? This is a partnership, remember?"
Jesse,"I remember. You cook, I sell. That was the division of labor when we started all this. And that's exactly how we should have kept it. 'Cause I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk or on my knees with a g*n to my head before your greedy old ass came along, all right?"
Walter,"All right, I will admit to a bit of a learning curve. And perhaps I was overly ambitious. But in any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore."
Jesse,"Damn straight. Know why? 'Cause we do things my way this time, or I walk. You need me more than I need you, Walt."
Jesse,"Enter my casa. Yo, Skinny Pete."
Skinny Pete,"What's up, brother?"
Jesse,"Eh, Combo. Good to see you. Welcome to my humble abode."
Combo,"Good deal, mover. Good deal."
Jesse,"Yo. Badge, hey."
Badger,"Cool crib, man. It echoes."
Jesse,"Let me give you a virtual tour. Plasma is gonna go right here. Probably, like, a 50-inch wall-mounted."
Skinny Pete,"Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo."
Combo,"Nah. They burn in, yo."
Skinny Pete,"But the picture's way sharper. Blacks are deeper, too."
Badger,"They got 3-D coming out, like, any day now. That's what I'm waiting for. p*rn, cuz!"
Jesse,Jesus.
Badger,"Like, 3-D ta-tas, like, right in your face."
Jesse,"So, I'm gonna get a couple of those zero-gravity chairs for right here, for your ultimate viewing comfort."
Combo,Those are buck.
Jesse,"It's gonna be pretty much sparse. Very Asian-y, modern stuff."
Skinny Pete,"Feng shui, yo. I can dig it."
Jesse,"And I'm thinking, just a bunch of candles, maybe one of those little fountain jobs right here. It's gonna be chill."
Combo,"The ladies, they cream up real nice for, like, candles and sh1t."
Badger,"You are going to score, big time!"
Jesse,"All right, so how about we get, you know, down to it? There's some refreshments over here if you want to partake."
Combo,You got any other refreshments?
Skinny Pete,I could kick it. It's been a while.
Badger,I could totally go for a lovin' spoonful.
Jesse,"No b*mb, no beer, no weed. You smoke it up on your own time. We're talking business here. So listen up. This is how it goes. I front each of you an ounce. You sell it for 2,500. I keep the two, you keep the five. No cutting it. You sell it as is, all right?"
Combo,"That's kinda, like, hopeful, bro."
Skinny Pete,"Street's maybe 17, 18."
Jesse,"This is the best shiz ever. Everybody and their mother's gonna want a taste. And second, who else is selling right now, huh?"
Skinny Pete,"It's dry out there, that's for sure."
Combo,Church.
Jesse,"So you point it how you want, okay? Quarter, half, teener, whatever. But I make what I make. Two large. No exceptions. Short me, you're out. Cut it, you're out. Period. This is a big opportunity I am giving you. Understand? Badger, what is this?"
Badger,A big opportunity.
Jesse,"Exactly. All right? This is the ground floor. Gentlemen, how far you go is up to you."
Combo,"So bring out the product, yo."
Jesse,"Not here, all right? Not ever. Blind drop. I will let you know when and where. All right? You'll be hearing from me. Now, I got mad volume, so you move it quick, you move it right. There is always more. DBAA, mo-fos. All right? Apply yourselves."
Marie,It's an armpit.
Hank,It's not an armpit.
Marie,"Excuse me. You're right. It's the Paris of the Southwest. Please, it's Texas, for God's sake. Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell. Human heads, they leave. The cartels, they litter the place with human heads."
Hank,Pretty sure that's why I'm going there.
Marie,"It's like a calling card or a shout-out or something. Now, D.C, on the other hand, I could get behind. You just do your time like a good boy, and I could see us in a cute little condo in Georgetown in a couple of years."
Marie,"I went online to this fantastic real estate website for D.C. There's just so much, I don't know, culture there. I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife. The one with the helmet hair and the permanent lip liner. Anyway, she was saying that..."
Skyler,Apologize.
Marie,What?
Skyler,I will not listen to one more word until you apologize.
Marie,For?
Skyler,"You know perfectly well, Marie."
Marie,"Well, obviously I don't."
Skyler,Your lies. To me. The shoplifting? All of it? Did you really think it was all just neatly gonna go away?
Marie,If you hadn't tried to return it...
Skyler,Apologize. Now or never. I mean it. Or it'll never be the same.
Marie,Why are you punishing me?
Skyler,"If you don't respect me enough to apologize, to tell me the truth, then...  I need my sister back."
Marie,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hank,"You want the gory details? No, you don't. Keep you up at night."
Walter Jr,So was it scary?
Hank,"Hell, yeah, it was freakin' scary, you little punk. Jesus."
Walter Jr,But you were way faster than him.
Hank,"Well, I'm here, aren't I?"
Walter Jr,"Hell, yeah. Kick ass and take names."
Walter,Son.
Hank,"Nah, it's fine. You know what it is? A cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do? I mean, you don't think about it. You stomp 'em down."
Walter,"Where do they come from? Criminals, like the one you...What do you think it is that makes them who they are."
Hank,"Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches. All I know is there's a whole world of them out there. Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse."
Walter,I wasn't sure it was you. New car?
Jesse,"Yeah, keeping things on the D.L."
Walter,I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.
Jesse,Your half. That's what I'm talking about. You're welcome. Jesus.
Walter,"Help me understand the math, okay? I gave you 1 pound, correct? You and I split $2,000 per ounce. $1,000 each. 1 pound, that’s 16 ounces. 16 ounces should net to me, $16,000. Not 15."
Jesse,Something came up.
Walter,Something came up?
Jesse,"One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies. Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool."
Walter,"Oh, so you're saying that your guy got robbed. Or, rather, you got robbed, but it doesn't matter."
Jesse,"Dude, it's called breakage, okay? Like K-Mart. Shit breaks."
Walter,And you're thinking this is acceptable?
Jesse,"It's the cost of business, yo. You're sweating me over a grand?"
Walter,"Look, I'm just the chemist, here. I'm not the street guy, yo. But it seems to me that what you call ""breakage"" is just you making a fool of yourself. I've got another technical term for you. ""Non-sustainable business model."""
Jesse,You're focusing on the negative. Six grand a day we're making. What's your problem?
Walter,"What happens when word gets out, and it's open season on these clowns you've hired? Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman, drug lord, can be robbed with impunity."
Jesse,"Man, come on."
Walter,"You think Tuco had breakage? I guess it's true, he did. He broke bones. He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off."
Jesse,You want another grand? Is that it?
Walter,Not my point.
Jesse,"Take it! Here. Look, you got 15,000 you didn't have yesterday. We're making bank. Shit happens. My guys get what they're up against, and they're careful. So am I. And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family. So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?"
Walter,You've made the division of labor very clear.
Jesse,"Yo, I mean, seriously. What the hell do you want me to do, huh?"
Skyler,Sorry.
Walter,You snuck in. Didn't even know you were home. What you eating?
Skyler,A panini. There's another one in the freezer if you want it.
Walter,"I thought we nixed those, huh?"
Skyler,Did we?
Walter,"Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones with the off-the-chart sodium?"
Skyler,I had a craving. Once in a while is no big deal.
Walter,So where's Junior?
Skyler,Out.
Walter,With whom?
Skyler,Louis.
Walter,Out where?
Skyler,Somewhere. I don't know. He'll be back by 9 00.
Walter,I just thought you might have a clue where your son is.
Skyler,"Why don't you? Why am I the only one who needs to keep track of our son? I'll tell you what, Walt. You want to know where he is, ask him. Just pick up the phone like I do."
Walter,Perhaps you might know something about this.
Skyler,"Perhaps. And then again, perhaps I don't. Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state."
Walter,"I'd like an explanation. Why would you do this? You're pregnant, for God's sakes."
Skyler,Three and a half cigarettes is not going to do a thing to the baby. Not a thing.
Walter,"I'm glad you're so sure, Doctor."
Skyler,"Three and a half. That was it. I tossed the rest. And I'm sure you'll be very glad to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed. This is something that..."
Walter,This is so unlike you.
Skyler,"Oh, really? How would you know?"
Walter,You asked me what I want you to do. I want you to handle it.
Skinny Pete,"What up? Damn, bitch."
Jesse,Got something for me?
Skinny Pete,"Yeah, I found them."
Jesse,Is this a 5 or an S?
Skinny Pete,"5. No, wait. S. Yeah, a 5."
Jesse,"Jesus, how the hell do you spell ""street"" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?"
Skinny Pete,"Hey, man. I'm slinging mad volume and fat-stackin Benjis, you know what I'm saying? I can't be all about, like, spelling and shit."
Jesse,So they got names?
Skinny Pete,"Hers is, like, I don't know. She's just this woman is all. Him they call Spooge."
Jesse,"Spooge? Not Mad Dog, not Diesel? So let me get this straight. You got jacked by a guy named Spooge?"
Skinny Pete,"Yo, what's his name matter? All's I saw was that knife he stuck in my face, like that big! But if you're looking for a reason not to go do this thing..."
Jesse,Did I say that?
Skinny Pete,"'Cause I'll go do it myself, right? It's just I'm on probation and all. So you gonna do it? Good. Right on. 'Cause these two, they need to get got."
Jesse,"Where's my money, bitch? Where's my money? Where’s my money, bitch? Huh, bitch? Where’s my money bitch? Oh, that's good. Where’s my money, bitch? Bitch, where’s my money? Come on. I will mess you up. Is that how you want to play this? Your call. Your funeral, Jack. Do not mess with me. I will bury you 'cause I'm crazy, yo. Mucho loco. Do not test me."
Mail Woman,Good morning!
Jesse,Good morning.
Mail Woman,"Honey, you blocking the mailbox."
Jesse,Sorry.
Mail Woman,"I think it's gonna be a nice day, huh?"
Jesse,"Yeah, high 70s."
Mail Woman,You have a great day.
Jesse,Right on. You too.
Jesse,"God! Shit! Anybody home? Yo, is anybody else home? Where's your folks? They here? What's your name? My name's Diesel. Yo, don't you want to watch something other than this? Like, I don't know, Mr. Rogers? So when your folks coming home? Your dad, Mr. Spooge? When is he getting back?"
Kid,I'm hungry.
Marie,"Hey there, you three. Just wanted to wish Walt a good first day back. We'll be thinkin thinking about you teaching valences and covalences and...okay, that's officially all I remember. Good luck. Skyler, give me a call when you get a chance."
Gretchen,"Hi, Walt and Skyler. This is Gretchen Schwartz, just calling to say hello. I'm down from Santa Fe today, and I was just thinking about you both, hoping everything's well. I tried Walt's cell, and it said the number had been disconnected, so I'm just hoping that everything's okay. Call me if you can, whenever's convenient."
Skyler,This is Skyler White. Am I catching you at a bad time?
Gretchen,"No, not at all. It's so good to hear from you. How is everybody?"
Skyler,"Very well, thank you. Walt is actually at work today. It's his first day back at work, and he lost his cell phone quite a while back. And I really hope we didn't worry you."
Gretchen,I'm just so glad to hear that everybody's fine. That's wonderful.
Skyler,"I'm so very, very long overdue in telling you this, and I just have to take Walt at his word that he's been passing it along for me. I mean, he's been so adamant about wanting to handle this whole thing by himself. But I have picked up the phone about a hundred times. I just..."
Gretchen,What is it?
Skyler,"I can't begin to thank you and Elliott for what you've done. The money for Walt's treatment, it's just, it's saved us."
Gretchen,I don't know if I...
Skyler,"Walt keeps saying, ""Don't bother them. It's no big deal."" But it is a big deal. To me. And to all of us. So I just finally wanted to say thank you. Anyway. End of speech. So, I do hope we get to see you soon. Truly, anytime you're in town, anytime at all is good for us."
Gretchen,How about this afternoon?
Walter,"Monoalkenes, diolefins, trienes, polyenes. The nomenclature alone is enough to make your head spin. But when you start to feel overwhelmed, and you will, just keep in mind that one element. Carbon. Carbon is at the center of it all. There is no life without carbon. Nowhere. That we know of in the universe. Everything that lives, lived, will live. Carbon. Carmen is carbon. Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen. Did you…? I like to think of it, I like to think that the diamond and the woman who wears it on her finger are both formed from the same stuff. Or, say the diamond and the man who invented it. That got your attention, right? The man who invented the diamond. All right. H. Tracy Hall. Write this name down. Dr. Hall invented the first reproducible process for making synthetic diamonds. I mean, this is way back in the '50s. Now, today, synthetic diamonds are used in oil drilling, electronics, and multi-billion dollar industries. At the time, Dr. Hall worked for General Electric. And he made them a fortune. I mean, incalculable. You want to know how GE rewarded Dr. Hall? A $10 US Savings Bond. Anyway. A Savings Bond printed on carbon-based paper paid to a carbon-based man for something he made out of carbon."
Carmen,"It's so nice to have you back with us, Walt. And you're looking great, by the way."
Walter,A little skinnier. Which is definitely no tragedy. And then there's the hair thing.
Carmen,I actually like that. That's a great look for you. But you're feeling good?
Walter,"Absolutely. 100%. I'm glad to be back at work. I'm glad to, I'm happy to be here. Really."
Carmen,"We're happy too. And I just, it's good. It's great."
Walter,Is everything okay?
Carmen,"Just please feel comfortable coming to me with any problems, any issues. Anything at all. You know, completely confidential."
Jeffrey,"See you tomorrow, Flynn."
Walter Jr,"See you, Jeffrey. Let me see it. Dad, let me see it."
Walter,Don't worry about it. Let's go.
Jesse,"Hey. Peekaboo. No? Peekaboo! Ah, man. You stay right here, all right? I mean it."
Spooge’s Wife,You shut up! You shut up! You're the one who dropped it.
Spooge,I didn't drop it! I didn't drop shit!
Spooge’s Wife,You dropped it!
Spooge,Shut the hell up about it.
Jesse,"You shut up! No, you shut up! Get up! Shut up! Both of you!"
Walter,"You know who might have done it? I have an idea. Here's what I think. You ID them. And then together, you and I put a bag over their heads. We tie them up, drive them way out into the desert, strip them naked, then bury them up to their necks on a huge mound of fire ants. Saw it in that old Western. You with me?"
Walter Jr,Scorpions?
Walter,Scorpions are good. Very nice.
Walter Jr,"Damn, Dad. Check it out. Who is this?"
Skyler,"So, this is Walter Jr. Or Flynn. He likes to go by Flynn these days."
Walter Jr,Mom.
Skyler,"What? I'm just offering the choice. This is Mrs. Schwartz, whom you've heard so much about."
Gretchen,"Very nice to meet you, Flynn."
Walter Jr,"Nice to meet you, too."
Walter,Look who's here. Always nice to see you. What a nice surprise.
Gretchen,Look at you. You're looking good.
Walter,Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.
Skyler,I know it was for me.
Gretchen,You have a good shaped head. May I?
Walter,"Oh, sure."
Gretchen,For good luck. Right?
Walter,"Exactly. Here's hoping. We could use some of that, huh?"
Walter Jr,Mrs. Schwartz? Thank you so much for what you've done for my dad. It was a really good thing.
Gretchen,You're very welcome.
Skyler,We're going to find a way to repay you.
Gretchen,"We don't want to ever hear that. You know what? I hate to say it, but I really need to get going."
Skyler,That's too bad. You can't stay for dinner?
Gretchen,"I wish I could, but unfortunately I have to try to beat the traffic."
Skyler,"Well, I hope we get a chance to catch up real soon."
Gretchen,Hopefully.
Skyler,"Your purse. Good to see you. And you and Elliott are welcome any time. Really. And I, for one, am gonna be much better about keeping in touch. It's so good to see you."
Gretchen,And you.
Walter Jr,Nice meeting you.
Gretchen,Likewise. Bye now.
Skyler,Drive safely.
Walter,What am I thinking? I should walk her to her car. Really. I'll be right back.
Walter,Gretchen. What did you... We need to talk. Can you not do or say anything to anyone until then? Please. Please.
Jesse,"Where's my money, bitch? I ain't going to keep asking nice! Yo, all right? I want my money and my dope! Come on!"
Spooge,"I just want to say, man..."
Jesse,What? What do you want to say?
Spooge,"I just want to go on record. You hit me really, really hard. I think I'm seeing double. Maybe I need to go see a hospital."
Jesse,Shut up!
Spooge,"Serious, I might have a concussion!"
Spooge’s Wife,"Don't fall asleep, baby."
Spooge,Subdural hematoma.
Spooge’s Wife,Don't fall asleep.
Jesse,"Shut up. Empty your pockets. Turn them out, everything on the table. Do it! All right, turn around. Turn around! Turn out your back pockets. Come on. All right. Shoes. Give them here."
Spooge,"I told you, Diesel, we ain't holding any."
Spooge’s Wife,We sh*t it all.
Jesse,"sh*t an ounce in a day and a half. All right, tell you what. Both of you pull it out of your butts right now or I grab a flashlight and some pliers and go exploring. What's it going to be, yo? Come on! There you go. All right, come on. On the table. So what? You hold the crystal, and she holds the H, huh?"
Spooge,Division of labor.
Jesse,"All right, there's maybe an 8-ball here. Where's the rest of my meth?"
Spooge,"Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo."
Spooge’s Wife,You shut up!
Spooge,"Shut up, skank."
Jesse,Shut up! Stop it!
Spooge,This really isn't getting any better. It's turning cranial.
Jesse,"You see this g*n, huh? It's got five b*ll*ts. One for each kneecap, plus an extra round for your cranial, for being such a p*ssy."
Spooge’s Wife,"Hey, baby. Come here, baby. Come here, baby."
Jesse,"All right. You two are never getting high again. I will make it my life's mission. Not another needle, not another ball, not one toke, not till I get what's mine."
Spooge,"We got you covered, man, sure. It just so happens we got your money, man, plus interest."
Jesse,"You're damn right, plus interest. Where?"
Spooge,"Backyard. Right hand to the man, dog. Backyard. Go check it out. Hurting. Painful."
Jesse,"Me and your old man, we're just playing a game, all right? Hey, don't move. Come on!"
Spooge,"See? Me and the slit just boosted it. She's like an ant, man. She can lift a hundred times her own weight. For real."
Jesse,What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
Spooge,"Help me break it open. Take out the money, get paid. Get high."
Jesse,That's my bank.
Spooge,So? It's FIDC insured. It's a victimless crime.
Jesse,Where the hell did you get this?
Spooge,"Bodega. Way across town. In, out, like bam. It was smooth as silk."
Jesse,"What, nobody saw you? What about witnesses, dumb ass?"
Spooge,"We roll like the breeze, for real. All we did, we just walked in all smooth-like. Nobody even noticed."
Jesse,Nobody noticed? For real?
Spooge,"I'm telling you. A victimless crime.
Scene  Spooge’s House"
Jesse,Jesus! Come on already!
Spooge,"It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it."
Jesse,"You don't know what you're doing. I thought you told me you boosted, like, six of these."
Spooge’s Wife,Boosted. It's not like he ever got one open.
Spooge,"At least I got persistence. The law of averages, lucky number 7. Don't listen to that skank."
Spooge’s Wife,Stop calling me that! I ain't no skank!
Spooge,"Skank, skank, skank ass skank!"
Jesse,"Sit. All right, I swear to God I will sh**t you both in the face! Now chill! You, get that thing open. You sit the hell down, and no throwing things. Where's the kid? The kid! The little kid!"
Spooge’s Wife,What are you asking me for?
Jesse,What the hell kind of mother are you? How about you feed the kid a decent meal every now and then? Give him a bath. Put some baby powder on him. Get him some decent TV to watch. What is this shit? Are you serious?
Spooge’s Wife,"You give me one hit, and I'll be any kind of mother that you want."
Spooge,"Diesel, this whole thing would go easier if we all had a little taste, man."
Jesse,Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
Walter,So you didn't tell anyone. You didn't tell Elliott.
Gretchen,Not yet.
Walter,What does that mean?
Gretchen,It means what it means. It's a determination I have yet to make.
Walter,All right. Fair enough. I can appreciate that. All right. First let me say I very much regret involving you in this. This entire thing was unfortunate.
Gretchen,Unfortunate?
Walter,And I apologize deeply.
Gretchen,Now please tell me why you did it.
Walter,That's not really at issue here.
Gretchen,"You told me your insurance was covering it. Was that a lie? If you won't take our money and your insurance isn't covering it, how are you paying for it?"
Walter,"This is not an issue that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?"
Gretchen,Excuse me. It does concern me. It concerns me greatly. You tell your wife and son that I am paying for your cancer treatment. Why are you doing this?
Walter,I will clear this up with them.
Gretchen,"The look on Skyler's face. She's sitting there, tears in her eyes, thanking me for saving your life. Why would you do that to her?"
Walter,"As I said, I will clear this up. Just please allow me to do this in my own way in my own time. All right? I will explain the whole thing to them."
Gretchen,"And while you're at it, explain it to me."
Walter,"I don't owe you an explanation. I owe you an apology, and I have apologized. I am very sorry, Gretchen. There. I've apologized twice now. I'm humbly sorry. Three times."
Gretchen,"Let me just get this straight. Elliott and I offer to pay for your treatment, no strings attached an offer which still stands, by the way and you turn us down out of pride, whatever, and then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment. Without our knowledge, against our will, you involve us in your lie. And you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business?"
Walter,That's pretty much the size of it.
Gretchen,"What happened to you? Really, Walt. What happened? Because this isn't you."
Walter,"What would you know about me? What would your presumption about me be, exactly? That I should go begging for your charity? And you waving your checkbook around, like some magic wand, is going to make me forget how you and Elliott cut me out?"
Gretchen,What? That can't be how you see it.
Walter,"It was my hard work, my research, and you and Elliott make millions off it."
Gretchen,That cannot be how you see it.
Walter,Good. That's beautifully done.
Gretchen,You left.
Walter,You are always the picture of innocence.
Gretchen,You left me.
Walter,The picture of innocence. Just sweetness and light.
Gretchen,"You left me. Newport, 4th of July weekend. You and my father and my brothers, and I go up to our room, and you're packing your bags, barely talking. What? Did I dream all that?"
Walter,That's your excuse to build your little empire on my work?
Gretchen,"How can you say that to me? You walked away. You abandoned us. Me, Elliott."
Walter,Little rich girl just adding to your millions.
Gretchen,"I don't even know what to say to you. I don't even know where to begin. I feel so sorry for you, Walt."
Walter,f*ck you.
Jesse,"Little man, you hungry? What are you doing?"
Spooge’s Wife,"Spooge, I got him, I got him. Baby, get up and help me! Call me a bad mother. I'll show you a bad mother, bitch. Get up, damn it! Get our dope! Bedtime."
Spooge,"Here we go. Who's the big tough guy now? Is that you? You're the big man? Try and hit me now, bitch! Try and hit me now! Try and hit me now, bitch!"
Skyler,"Should I ask where you've been? Never mind. We're long past that, I suppose. Gretchen called about an hour ago. We need to talk."
Walter,Just say it.
Skyler,They're cutting off the money.
Walter,"What did she say, exactly?"
Skyler,"Not much. It was abrupt. She said something like ""I'm sorry to have to do this, but Elliott and I can no longer continue to pay for Walt's treatment. I wish you the very best."" And that was it. She sounded apologetic I guess. It was quick. She got right off the phone. I was so stunned, but I called her back, and she didn't pick up. So what do you know about this? She and I had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon, and then you come home, and all of a sudden she's in a big hurry to leave, and then the two of you are talking in the driveway. What do you know that I don't? Where were you tonight?"
Walter,"I drove up to Santa Fe. I was with Gretchen. Well, Gretchen and Elliott. She just couldn't bring herself to tell you today. I mean, she couldn't tell me, either, really. There was a lot of hemming and hawing and beating around the bush from both of them."
Skyler,What? Tell us what?
Walter,"There was a lot of business phraseology being tossed around. Things like ""cash poor"" and ""leveraged"" and ""quarterly decline,"" yada, yada, yada. But what they were truly saying, in my opinion, they're broke."
Skyler,You are kidding me.
Walter,"I mean, the economy's in the toilet. We all know that. And all these big banks and Fannie Mae and apparently, Gray Matter is no more immune than anyone else."
Skyler,"That is...Jesus, that's, she could have just told me herself."
Walter,"Well, they're prideful people. Listen. Not to sound selfish, but as far as we go, we'll get through this, okay? They've already paid for most of my treatment, right? We're going to make it. All right? I promise."
Skyler,And yet she still drives a Bentley.
Walter,Keeping up appearances or I don't know. Who knows?
Spooge’s Wife,"Baby, that don't make any sense."
Spooge,"Of course it makes sense. Every safe's got its weak spot, right? Say you're designing a safe. Where are you going to put your weak spot?"
Spooge’s Wife,"Nowhere. I made it, like, strong."
Spooge,"Jesus! On the bottom, that's where. You put your weak spot on the bottom."
Spooge’s Wife,"Baby, that H is bringing me down."
Spooge,You took too much. I told you.
Spooge’s Wife,I need... I need to even out. Let me get a hit of that crystal.
Spooge,"Hell, no. You've lost your share."
Spooge’s Wife,"Come on, baby. It's all I need is just a little hit."
Spooge,"Shut the hell up, you dumb skank. I'm trying to concentrate."
Spooge’s Wife,I ain't no skank. I would appreciate an apology.
Spooge,What?
Spooge’s Wife,I am trying to take the high road here. Are you going to do right?
Spooge,"Listen to me, stupid. I am in the middle of some very important work. I am on the verge here, all right? So shut your skank ass pie hole and assist me and shut up!"
Spooge’s Wife,I ain't no skank.
Spooge,"Skank, skank, skank ass skank! Skank ass skank! Skank ass skank! You listening to me skank? You hear me, skank? You are a skank ass skank!"
Spooge’s Wife,I ain't no skank.
Jesse,"No, don't!"
Spooge’s Wife,I ain't no skank.
Jesse,"Remember peekaboo? Can you go peekaboo like this? Can you keep your eyes closed? You keep them closed. That's good. That's real good. All right. You keep them closed just like that. It's a little game we're going to play. Look at me. You wait right here. Okay? It's just part of the game. You wait right here, and...look, just don't go back inside. All right? You stay right here. Okay? You have a good rest of your life, kid."
Walter,"Nitrogen bonds to oxygen, which, in turn...you do know what a bond is? A strong force of attraction. Covalent bonds, ionic bonds. The coming together of atoms and molecules to form compounds? Chemical bonds are what make matter matter. Bonds are what hold the physical world together, what hold us together."
Barry,I got it. Bonds.
Walter,Your test score says otherwise. It tells me you don't get it at all.
Barry,"I mean, 58. I was close."
Walter,"What is close? There's no ""close"" in science, Barry. There are right answers and wrong answers. ""Close"" didn't put men on the moon."
Barry,"I'm just saying, Mr. White, 2 points? If I don't pass chemistry, I have to go to summer school. I mean, I really studied. Like, really, really studied, like, all night hard. I'm so into chemistry for, like, the concepts. I just think I might have the attention deficit. Couldn't you please just let this slide?"
Walter,"Don't bullshit a bullshitter. The answer is no. Next time, apply yourself."
Jesse,"Yo, if I know you, leave a message."
Walter,"Are you ducking me or what? This makes the third time. Look, I will be leaving this phone on for another 15 minutes, so call me. And by the way, that thing we talked about? When I said ""handle it""? Well, don't. Let it go. All right."
Walter,Jesse. Open the door. I know you're home. Your car is here. Come on. Jesse!
Jane,Can I help you?
Walter,No.
Jane,"Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop with the pounding, please?"
Walter,"You're the manager? You can help me. Absolutely. I very much need to get inside here. So if you have a master key...you have a key, right?"
Jane,"Yeah, I have a key."
Walter,"Look, the person who lives here, it's just very important for me to see him."
Jane,"And you knocked, right? He didn't answer? Which means?"
Walter,"Look, I'm his father, all right?"
Jane,You're Mr. Jackson?
Walter,That's me. Walt Jackson. And you are?
Jane,Jane.
Walter,"Very nice to meet you, Jane. Now, if you wouldn't mind..."
Jane,"Mr. Jackson, I'm happy to let you use my phone. Want to call him?"
Walter,"As I said, I would like to have you let me inside here so that I can check on my son's well-being. You understand?"
Jane,"Look, whatever's going on between the two of you is family. I don't get involved in family. Jesse doesn't want you in, you're not getting in. Period. Sorry."
Jesse,"Come on in, Dad."
Jane,You okay?
Walter,"Jesse Jackson? Do you even...I see you have a telephone at least. You know, that blinking thing I've been calling you on?"
Jesse,"Whatever, man. Give me my..."
Walter,I will break this! I will break this! Damn druggy idiot. Is this what you've been doing the whole time I've been trying to reach you?
Jesse,I've been taking care of business.
Walter,What business?
Jesse,"What business? The business you put me on, assh*le. You already forgot? This business! Does that jog your memory? Son of a bitch."
Walter,You didn't actually…
Jesse,"You said ""handle it."" So I handled it."
Walter,"When I said ""handle it,"" I meant fear and intimidation. Get your money back. I certainly never meant for you…"
Jesse,"You didn't mean to k*ll somebody? Too late, yo, because dude's dead."
Walter,"Oh, God."
Jesse,All right? Way dead.
Walter,"Oh, God."
Jesse,"Here. Here's your money. Your half. Spend it in good health, you miserable son of a bitch. I didn't say I k*lled him."
Walter,Tell me what happened.
Jesse,The dude's wife crushed his head with an ATM machine.
Walter,Crushed his…
Jesse,"Crushed his head with an ATM machine. Right in front of me. I mean, crushed it like...oh, my God, the sound It's still in my ears. You know, and the blood, like, everywhere. Like, there was so much, you would not believe. Man, will you just please give me my weed, all right? It helps with my nausea."
Walter,"So, you did not k*ll anyone. Does anybody think that you k*lled anybody?"
Jesse,I called the cops.
Walter,You called the cops?
Jesse,"I called and I split, and then they came in and busted her. God, she was so zapped out of her mind. She did it for, like, nothing. He told her she was a skank, but, I mean, she was a skank."
Walter,Can this person identify you? Can she identify you being there?
Jesse,"Dude, she couldn't identify her left ass cheek. She was so zonked. And she had this, God, she had this kid."
Walter,"Listen, I'm a little fuzzy on the mechanics, here. But could you not stop this woman from k*ll*ing this man?"
Jesse,"Look, she had a g*n on me, all right? Yeah, my g*n, okay? Mine. Go ahead. Say it. I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8. I can't run a crew. Come on. Point made, man. Point made."
Jesse,"Yo, if I know you, leave a message."
Badger,"It's Badger, man."
Skinny Pete,What are you doing? Don't use your real name.
Badger,"What? That isn't my real name. We got those pants you wanted. 32 large, right? We got them just for you, jefe. Let's do some bid-ness, yo."
Walter,"So, are you going to get back up on that horse?"
Jesse,You get on. All right? I just want to forget.
Hank,Sorry. What's up with that?
Vanco,Jesus Malverde. Patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.
Hank,"Hell, I know who it is, okay? Scumbags kneeling down, praying to him ""Please, Senor Saint-ay! No DEA, please!"" I'm just saying why is he on your desk? Going after neo-Nazis, you don't wear swastikas, right?"
Vanco,Sun Tzu.
Hank,Sun who?
Vanco,"Sixth century Chinese general. Wrote The Art of w*r. ""If you know your enemies yourself, you'll fight without danger in many battles."""
Hank,Right on.
Ramey,Agent Schrader.
Hank,Sir!
Ramey,Glad to have you on board. Everybody getting you settled in?
Hank,Great group of guys. And gals. Got guys. Guys and gals. That's good.
Ramey,"You couldn't have picked a better time to arrive. About to put a big dent in the cartel. Right, Vanco?"
Vanco,"Yes, sir."
Skinny Pete,"Bro, check it out. It's a satellite picture of you farting."
Badger,Fat Man and Little Boy. Sounds like you two.
Skinny Pete,"I got your Fat Man in my pants, bitch."
Combo,Watch it.
Skinny Pete,"It ain't real, dumbass."
Combo,"Watch it, is all."
Skinny Pete,You watch it.
Walter,I'm Heisenberg.
Badger,You're Heisenberg?
Skinny Pete,I remember you. You were the cook.
Walter,Let's get this over with.
Skinny Pete,Where's Jesse?
Walter,Busy.
Skinny Pete,That's cool.
Badger,Real cool.
Combo,"Totally cool. It's all there. Every dollar. In case you want to, like, count it."
Walter,Here?
Combo,"I'm just saying. Just saying, like, we cool, yo. We ain't got no confusion and interpretation as to who we work for."
Skinny Pete,"Man, that's church, yo. For real."
Walter,What have you heard?
Badger,"Did Jesse really I mean, did he really squash that dude's head with an ATM machine?"
Walter,Who's saying that?
Skinny Pete,"Damn, man, it's all over town. Everybody's like, whoa, snap! Usually I got to chase dudes down for their money. But today, everybody's paying up."
Combo,True that.
Badger,"Serious. But, like he really did it?"
Walter,You didn't hear that from me.
Skyler,Big lunch. Here you go.
Margaret,"Very good, Miss White. We'll consider your application and let you know."
Skyler,I'd just like to mention that I have worked here before.
Margaret,Really? When are you due?
Skyler,Several months.
Margaret,Congratulations. I see. Accounting department. You left us four years ago?
Skyler,Family.
Margaret,We'll definitely let you know. Thank you for coming by.
Skyler,"Actually, may I see Ted Beneke? I think he'll remember me."
Margaret,"Mr. Beneke's very busy today, unfortunately."
Skyler,"If it's okay, I'll just..."
Margaret,Ma'am.
Ted,"Skyler? Oh, my God, look at you."
Skyler,"Hey, Ted."
Ted,"Come in. No calls, Margaret. Sit down right here. You look great. A boy or a girl, or are you keeping it a secret?"
Skyler,It's a little girl. We're very excited.
Ted,I'll bet. One of each. How's Walt Jr?
Skyler,"Tenth grade and he's just growing like a weed. He's taller than I am now. I'm betting 6'3"", 6'4"" by the time he's finished."
Ted,"Wow, handsome. Oh, my God. Good genes."
Skyler,"Speaking of movie stars, those can't be the twins."
Ted,"Yep, that's them."
Skyler,They're gorgeous.
Ted,"Yes, they are. And they know it. I'm in real trouble there, huh?"
Skyler,"So, the big office?"
Ted,"Weird, isn't it? I still think of it as my dad's."
Skyler,I miss him.
Ted,"Me, too. I'd like to think he'd be proud. Last year was our best year yet."
Skyler,He'd be proud.
Ted,"Walt, how's he doing?"
Skyler,He is doing great. He's plugging away.
Ted,Great. He still teaching? You tell him I said hello.
Skyler,"I will definitely do that. To be honest, Ted, I didn't just stop by to say hello. I was applying for the data entry job."
Ted,You're kidding. You were like our go-to bookkeeper.
Skyler,"The economy, you know, so."
Ted,"Well, data entry, that'd be a mistake. How about getting your old job back? We're expanding and between you and me, that whole department is pretty much of a mess. Your work would be cut out for you. But we could use your help."
Walter,"Now, this is our territory, right? Currently. Hello? Correct. All right, then. Now, look at this. Here, here, here and here. What does that look like to you? Opportunities. Golden ones. That's what that looks like. Look. It's an entire city full of buyers. Now, why aren't we exploiting that?"
Jesse,Because it's not our territory.
Walter,Because we lack initiative.
Jesse,Initiative?
Walter,"You need to employ more dealers. Double, triple your crew. Those three I met they should each have three, six, nine sub-dealers working for them. Exponential growth that's the key."
Jesse,"It's not our territory. Man, you follow me, here? We go rolling into these neighborhoods, other crews ain't going to take kindly. You understand?"
Walter,"Sure. They won't like it. But I say they're not going to do a thing about it. Listen, Jesse. The game has changed. The word is out. And you are a k*ller."
Jesse,What are you talking about?
Walter,Apparently it's all over town. Somebody crossed you. You got angry. You crushed their skull with an ATM machine.
Jesse,But that's not how it happened.
Walter,Who cares? Just as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police.
Jesse,My God.
Walter,"Don't you see how great this is? Look, you are a Jesse, look at me. You are a blowfish."
Jesse,What?
Walter,"A blowfish. Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators. But the blowfish has a secret w*apon, doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse? What does the blowfish do?"
Jesse,I don't even...
Walter,"The blowfish puffs up. The blowfish puffs himself up four or five times larger than normal. And why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's why. Intimidating, so that the other scarier fish are scared off. And that's you. You are a blowfish. You see? It's just all an illusion. See? It's nothing but air. Now, who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?"
Jesse,Nobody.
Walter,You're damn right.
Jesse,I'm a blowfish.
Walter,You are a blowfish. Say it again.
Jesse,I'm a blowfish.
Walter,Say it like you mean it.
Jesse,I'm a blowfish! Yeah!
Walter,That's it.
Jesse,Blowfishing this up.
Tortuga,"The SkyMall. Give me the SkyMall, would you? Vanco, new guy don't speak Spanish. What's up? Hey, white boy, better learn Espanol, huh? This ain't Branson, Missouri. You know what I'm talking about? You know what? I'll teach you. It means ""Let's make a deal."" So go ahead. We're waiting. Vaya, vaya. Right here. Item SS4G. Yankee Stadium, ""Final Season"" Commemorative Baseball, hand-signed by Derek Jeter. Vanco, write this down. Man, watch out. Large size floor runner. Look at that. It's a rug you put on the floor, except for it looks like a hundred dollar bill. I love them. Get me 20 of them. I'm going to put them all over my casa."
Ramey,We'll get you three.
Tortuga,You give me ten.
Ramey,Five.
Hank,"How about you stop jerking us off, here? Where's the meet? When's it going down?"
Tortuga,"White boy don't like ""Let's make a deal."""
Hank,"White boy's going to kick your ass, you don't stop wasting his time."
Ramey,Schrader.
Tortuga,White boy. My name's Tortuga. You know what that means?
Hank,"Well, if I had to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for ""assh*le.”"
Tortuga,"""Tortuga"" means ""turtle."" That's me. I take my time, but I always win. That reminds me. Wait, I seen this earlier, lookit. This is awesome, homes. Right there. Look at that. The Tranquil Tortoise garden sculpture. Definitely two of those. Check it out. Mira. Good likeness."
Marie,Hank's doing great down there. He's really making inroads.
Skyler,"I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all. So, you going to go down to El Paso?"
Marie,"Please. It's third-world enough around here. They keep him busy every second. He's already got some big operation going, some kind of hush-hush deal. He couldn't tell me a thing about it except it's on the other side of the border."
Skyler,"That sounds exciting. He's being safe, right?"
Marie,"He says he's mostly riding a desk, which between you and me, is how I want it."
Skyler,Speaking of riding desks I got myself a job today.
Marie,You did not. As big as you are?
Skyler,Thank you.
Marie,"You know I just mean...Where? With who? Well, someone willing to work around that, apparently."
Skyler,Beneke.
Marie,You did not. Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?
Skyler,"It was one time at a Christmas party, and he was so drunk he was practically slurring his words."
Marie,Just what you want in an executive.
Skyler,"And he apologized profusely. Plus, he's married. He doesn't want to get sued for sexual harassment. It will not happen again."
Marie,Is money that tight? You know we can always help out.
Skyler,You know Walt. He would just…
Marie,Speak of the devil.
Walter,How are you? What's up?
Marie,Nothing much. How's things with you?
Walter,Good.
Skyler,Dinner will be about an hour. And…
Walter,"Thanks, honey."
Skyler,Everything okay?
Walter,Everything's perfect.
Walter Jr,"This is Raisin Bran, not Raisin Bran Crunch."
Skyler,So? Same thing.
Walter Jr,Not the same thing.
Skyler,I'll tell you what. Why don't you do the grocery shopping? And then you can get whatever you want. Great!
Walter Jr,"It's not that hard, Mom. It says ""crunch"" on the box."
Skyler,You're pushing it.
Walter,Morning.
Skyler,"Morning, honey."
Walter Jr,"Dad, notice anything?"
Walter,Is there a funeral today?
Skyler,"A funeral? Christ, do I look that bad?"
Walter Jr,Mom got a job.
Walter,A job? Why?
Skyler,Do I need to get out the checkbook and show you?
Walter,Is this a good idea in your condition?
Skyler,The doctor said I can work practically up until I go into labor. And it's just an office job. I'm just sitting on my butt.
Walter,Where?
Skyler,Beneke. I'm back working in the accounting department.
Walter,"Skyler, what about the welding fumes? Isn't that why you had to quit in the first place?"
Skyler,They've gone green since then. They have some kind of green welding or something. I didn't smell anything when I was in there.
Walter,Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away? Who's running things?
Skyler,"Ted. His son. Anyway, I have got to go. I don't want to be late on my first day back. Wish me luck."
Walter,Good luck.
Jane,You left your cave.
Jesse,I was kind of missing my TV. I was thinking maybe I'd hit Costco. Snag a big-ass wide screen. So What you drawing? Damn. That's good. It'd make a hell of a tat.
Jane,That's the plan.
Jesse,Really?
Jane,I work part-time down at ABQ Ink.
Jesse,Right on. You're a real good drawer. I used to do a little of that.
Jane,"You used to be a drawer, too? What stopped you?"
Jesse,"You know, just...so, tell me something. What kind of tattoo artist has no tattoos?"
Jane,That's way too big a commitment.
Biker,"You're Pinkman. You're the man! Everybody's been talking about you. Right on, man. Keep it real."
Jane,"Pinkman, huh? I thought your name was Jackson."
Hank,Your snitch has really earned his nickname. Are we just on manana time?
Vanco,They'll show.
Hank,"Why's that? You got more catalogs for him to clean out? You know, Sharper Image or Pottery Barn? Something I need to know about?"
Vanco,"What? That? We were just, singing your praises. Glad to have you. Welcome aboard."
Hank,Is that your guy? I think that's your guy. What the hell is he doing down there?
Vanco,Where you going?
Hank,"We need an evidence bag, right? Pretty big one."
Vanco,"What's the matter? You act like you never saw a severed human head on a tortoise before. Welcome to - ah! God damn, my leg!"
Jesse,"The game has changed, yo. This is our city. All right? All of it. The whole damn place. Our territory. We're staking our claim. We sell when we want, where we want. We're going to be kings. Understand? Well, I'm going to be king and you guys will be princes or dukes or something."
Badger,I want to be a knight.
Jesse,"First thing's first. We got to get more dealers. Foot soldiers. Right? Now they'll be working for you. You're working for me, and they're working for you. You follow me? Layered, like nachos. Exponential growth. Now that's success, with a capital ""S"". Straight up."
Skinny Pete,For shizzle.
Badger,Friggin' awesome.
Jesse,"We're set. Our boys are ready. Gonna be some mad cheddar. Cheddar, Mr. White. Fat stacks, dead presidents. Cash money. We're going to own this city."
Walter,We're not charging enough.
Jesse,What?
Walter,"Corner the market, then raise the price. Simple economics."
Skyler,Come on in.
Ted,Looks like they got you all set up.
Skyler,"Yeah. It's perfect. I am close enough to the bathroom not to waddle too far, and that's very nice."
Ted,I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
Skyler,"Listen, I wanted to thank you for having me back."
Ted,You don't have to thank me. I need you.
Skyler,"It's a little early for wine, isn't it?"
Ted,Damn. It's grape juice. I've been making the girls breakfast in the morning.
Skyler,How's Denise doing?
Ted,We split up about a year ago.
Skyler,I'm sorry.
Ted,"She's definitely happier now. I guess I am, too, most days. Together since high school."
Skyler,I remember that.
Ted,Anyway I don't know. People change. I just wanted to welcome you back. I'll see you around the vending machines. We should have lunch one day. Like old times.
Skyler,Sure.
Jesse,"So, listen. My name's not really Jesse Jackson. It's Jesse Pinkman. And that guy you met, he's not my dad. You're not going to kick me out, are you? 'Cause I actually really like it here."
Jane,I don't make it my business what you do. So long as you don't do it here.
Jesse,"So, I got this kick-ass new flat-screen. Want to see?"
Jesse,"It's got that thing where the blacks are, like, you know, really, really, really black, and the Dolby six-point-whatever, so it'll really rock the house. But I'll, you know I'll keep it way down. Of course. I don't know what the hell's taking so long. Come on."
Cop,You selling?
Badger,I don't know what you're talking about.
Cop,"That's cool. I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling, I could maybe do with a teenth."
Badger,"You're kidding, right? Dude, I so smell bacon."
Cop,What? What are you talking about?
Badger,"Gee, I don't know. How about over there. That brown van. That's yours, right?"
Cop,What brown van?
Badger,"Parked all inconspicuous. It's a cop van. Another one right over there. ""Duke City Flowers?” Come on! Can't you at least be original?"
Cop,"Dude, I just want to get high."
Badger,"A flower van. You know what you should do is a garbage truck. Seriously. And I don't mean to disrespect. But if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way, I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck. It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it. Think about it, boys!"
Cop,All right. I'm hitting it.
Badger,You dudes give up that easy?
Cop,I'm not a cop.
Badger,Then lift your shirt. Show me you're not wearing a wire.
Cop,"All right, you know what? Just to show you you're being an assh*le."
Badger,I'm blinded by white!
Cop,Douchebag.
Badger,"Come on. I was joking. Come on. Don't walk away angry. Sit down. Come on. I mean, what are you complaining about? You got abs, man. Kinda."
Cop,"Whatever, dude. I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore. I think you turned me off to the whole thing."
Badger,"Come on. Don't be like that. I just need you to prove it, you know? Prove you're not a cop."
Cop,How the hell am I supposed to do that?
Badger,I don't know. I got it. Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Cop,Which dude? That dude? No way. He'd kick my ass.
Badger,"True that. This is so hard, you know?"
Cop,"I know. It's simple. If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you. It's in the Constitution."
Badger,Constitution of America?
Cop,So go ahead and ask.
Badger,Are you a cop?
Cop,"Not like that. Ask it, like, official."
Badger,Are you a police officer?
Cop,I am not a police officer.
Badger,"Okay, then. The price is the price, yo. All right. There you go. Enjoy."
Cop,"Thanks, man. Albuquerque Police! You're under arrest! Get on the ground! Get on your stomach now! On your stomach, get on the ground! Hold it, don't move! Stay down!"
Commercial Guy #1,I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing. I'd better call Saul!
Commercial Guy #2,"I was out partying, minding my own business."
Girl Cop,You are under arrest.
Commercial Guy #2,I'd better call Saul!
Saul,"Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution says you do. And so do I. I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent. And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque! Better call Saul. Saul Goodman, attorney at law."
Jesse,I really need to get some furniture.
Jane,I suggest you start with a bed.
Jesse,"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
Jane,"Well, you can't."
Jesse,I know. I know. I'm just saying.
Jane,Don't think I can't smell that weed. You better seriously hope that airs out. My dad will keep your security deposit. He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Jesse,Has he ever caught you?
Jane,Many times.
Jesse,"Well, listen. Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up. You sure? Well, is it cool if I burn one? Maybe you'll change your mind."
Jane,"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Jesse,What'd I say?
Jane,Nothing. I just have to go is all.
Jesse,What's this?
Jane,"My 18-month chip. I'm in recovery. And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Jesse,"Recovery? That's cool. Right on. I respect that. You know, I don't really burn much anymore. It's just a sometime thing. But no more, like, in the house. So, you want to go grab some dinner? I could really go for some Chinese."
Jane,I better hit it.
Jesse,We cool?
Jane,"Your satellite's on, by the way. That screen's bad-ass."
Walter,I just think it's asking a lot.
Walter,Is this going to be every weekend now?
Skyler,"It's just the end of the quarter. You remember how that was. But I am earning double time. There's a bright side. So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers. And I said ""Bye."" And tell him to let them air dry this time. I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer. What?"
Walter,"What, you don't even get a casual Saturday? You look nice is all."
Skyler,It's work. Everybody's gonna be there. Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Walter,"Hi. You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior. Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Marie,Skyler? Are you there? I just don't know what to do. I need to talk to you.
Walter,It's me. What's up?
Marie,Yesterday I got home and found him. He didn't even tell me he was coming.
Walter,A man was k*lled?
Marie,"A federale, right in front of him. Three agents wounded, one lost his leg. It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something. The IEDs. Oh, Jesus. I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez. Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour. Hank should win an Oscar. He's so damn breezy with the man. He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed. And all he keeps saying is, ""I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."""
Hank,"Baby, not now."
Walter,"It's me, Hank. Sorry."
Hank,"Hey, buddy. What's up?"
Walter,"I just, do you mind if I...So how you doing?"
Hank,"You know. Lousy. Montezuma's Revenge, big time. I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tin horn. Better not get too close."
Walter,I'll take my chances.
Hank,I guess you heard about what happened down in Juarez?
Walter,Terrible.
Hank,"What do you expect? Freakin' animals. Like Apocalypse Now down there. It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle. And my SAC in El Paso sends me home. Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh? You don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards, you send him home. I was, you know, ""He's out getting an evidence bag, and so ends up without a scratch on him."" So must be something wrong with that picture."
Walter,So are you home for good?
Hank,"Playing it by ear. ""To be determined."""
Walter,Think you might want to talk it through with somebody?
Hank,"What? A shrink? I can't. Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
Walter,"Or Marie. Or me, if you like."
Hank,"You know, I don't know how to say this. You know, the things I deal with, you and me don't have much of what you might call an experiential overlap."
Walter,"What if I told you we do? I have spent my whole life scared. Frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen. Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine. And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it. That's the real enemy. So get up. Get out in the real world. And you kick that b*st*rd as hard as you can right in the teeth."
Walter,Do it again. Go on.
Jesse,"$10,000 even. Same as last time. It's totally accurate."
Walter,"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine. I want it running 24 hours a day."
Jesse,Right on.
Walter,"Not yours, I take it."
Jesse,"We got 10, 20, 30, 44, five each."
Walter,Three pounds should be 48 each. Who's short?
Jesse,"Don't freak. We didn't get ripped off. Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount. I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Walter,Then wake him up. He can sleep after we're paid.
Jesse,Why you gotta be such a hard on?
Walter,You're not his pal. You're his boss. This only works when they're scared of you.
Jesse,Jack off. It's going straight to voicemail.
Walter,Voicemail?
Jesse,"Just chill, okay? Count your money. Combo, you seen Badger? Yo, don't you cover for him, bitch! I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer!"
Walter,Well?
Jesse,They were too scared to tell me. Badger got busted. He's in jail.
Hank,"Honey, I'm home! Too slow! What's up?"
Steve,You've got more lives than a damn cat.
Hank,"Now if I can only learn to lick myself. What's up, guys? Good to see you. All right! Let's all go back to work, for Christ's sake! In my office, man. Let's see what you bozos have been up to lately."
Steve,You okay? Hanging in?
Hank,What's it look like? What's this from APD?
Steve,"I been checking with them to see if they come across that blue meth of yours. Sure enough, last night. Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer. I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello. Maybe you'd like to go with me."
Hank,"Well, all right."
Badger,"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man. I feel manipulated. I thought we were gonna hang out."
Cop,"We are hanging out, Badger. You like Badger or Brandon?"
Badger,"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
Cop,"Badger, listen. I'm trying to help you here, man. If you just tell me who your supplier is, I think this can end very well for you."
Saul,"What are you doing talking to my client without me present? You Sneaky Pete! Which is which? What, did the Academy hire you right out of the womb? You guys get younger every...what'd you say to Baby-Face? Did you say anything stupid? By anything stupid, I mean anything at all. Look at you. Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter. We'll talk about it later. Right now, you out. Ten minutes ago! Go on! There are laws, detective. Have your kindergarten teacher read 'em to you. Go grab a juice box. Have a nap. Go on. All right. Who do we have? Brandon Mayhew. All right. Here we go. Public masturbation."
Badger,What?
Saul,"I don't get it. What's the kick? Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us with a big flat-screen TV. In a Starbucks. That's nice."
Badger,"That ain't me, man! I was the guy who was selling meth. Allegedly."
Saul,"All right. I got you. Meth. Right. Sorry, that was a little transpositional error. Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of. And a felony quantity."
Badger,Just barely.
Saul,"Yeah, just barely. The cops around here are like butchers, always got their thumbs on the scales. But good luck arguing that in court. Let me get down to brass tacks. I'm going to get you a second phone call. You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader, and they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650. I'll write that down on the back of my business card. And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter. Actually, I want it in a money order. And make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates. That's my loan-out. It's totally legit. It's done just for tax purposes. After that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask. Any questions?"
Badger,"You're gonna get me off, right?"
Saul,"I look like your high school girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting? That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up. Son, I promise you this. I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy."
Saul,"Francesca, I took these already. Didn't I take these already? Look, it's on your head. You're not supposed to double up on Vitamin A. It's bad for the liver. Okay, who's next? Did him. I did him. That one went public defender. Thanks for nothing. What happened to my masturbator? You got me all turned around. Hang on. I'll get back to you. Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client. Anything you care to share with me?"
Hank,Sure. Your commercials? They suck ass. I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Saul,"Is that like the one your mom works at? Is she still offering the two-for-one discount? DEA, huh? For a street bust. Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?
Scene  Parking Lot"
Jesse,"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen. You want your exponential growth, guys are gonna get busted. Simple as that."
Walter,"So how about we get him a real attorney? I mean, what the hell is this? This is who he hires?"
Jesse,What? Are you kidding me? This is the guy you want. This is the guy I'd hire.
Walter,"Oh, it's the guy you'd hire."
Jesse,"Look, you remember Emilio? This dude got Emilio off, like, twice. Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo. And then poof! Dude's like Houdini. Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don't want a criminal lawyer. You want a ""criminal"" lawyer. Know what I'm saying? Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White. Badger's way too loyal to roll. Plus he's scared shitless of me. We pay four large. Cost of business. Take it out of his payroll. And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario? They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
Walter,So who goes inside? I don't need them seeing my face.
Jesse,I don't need them seeing my face.
Walter,Why not? You look like his typical clientele.
Jesse,Dick.
Walter,Fine. We'll flip for it. Call it.
Jesse,Heads.
Francesca,Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?
Saul,"Mr. Mayhew. Nice of you to come down. Please. Look at you. Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B. Cooper? Joking. Please, come on. Come on. Please. Saul Goodman. Please sit. So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances. I believe you have something for me? Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?"
Walter,Irish.
Saul,"Faith and begorrah! A fellow potato-eater. My real name's McGill. The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys. They all want a pipe-hittin' member of the tribe, so to speak. I digress. Good things are happening. Fact is, your nephew's gonna get out in no time."
Walter,That's wonderful.
Saul,"There's still a few details to be ironed out, but now that the DEA is involved, I think he's looking at time served and probation. So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
Walter,"Excuse me, the DEA?"
Saul,"That's the Drug Enforcement Administration. The feds. I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news, but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers."
Walter,I understand that. But what does that have to do with the DEA?
Saul,"They're after some mystery man, some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg. They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey. Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest. Jesus, cheer up! This is good news. I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
Walter,"Look, look. I just think that we should review our options."
Saul,"Options? I'm gonna tell you what your options are. And you got a grand total of two. Option A, Brandon takes the deal. Option B, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big."
Walter,"Look, look. What about reprisals? I mean, if Badger, if Brandon informs on this Heisenberg I mean, what if, God forbid, that they decide to take revenge?"
Saul,"What have you been telling him? The kid keeps spouting off about ""if I talk, they'll k*ll me."" Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
Walter,Good.
Saul,"No, that's not good. That's terrible. Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks. You let him take his chances on the outside. Maybe I can work in some witness protection."
Walter,"No, look, look. These are vicious, desperate people. I've been told that one of them k*lled another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine."
Saul,"People love to take credit for the fun ones. The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine. His wife k*lled him, all right? It was open and shut. Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay? I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary, all's right with the world."
Walter,"$10,000. Cash to you. I'm not saying to throw the case. Just no talking to the DEA."
Saul,"Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Scene  Parking Lot"
Jesse,What's it going to be? That dude wouldn't take a bribe? That dude in there? Saul Goodman we're talking about?
Walter,"""Morally outraged,"" he said. Threatened to call the police."
Jesse,And Badger's gonna spill?
Walter,Like the Exxon Valdez.
Jesse,So what do we do about it?
Saul,"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
Francesca,No!
Saul,"For safety! What? God, you are k*ll*ing me with that booty."
Saul,"Talk to me, guys! Come on. Just tell me what you want! Jesus! No no no! It wasn't me! It was Ignacio! He's the one! ¡Siempre! ¡Soy amigo! ¡Siempre soy amigo del cartel!"
Jesse,"Shut up! Shut up! All right, just speak English."
Saul,Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?
Jesse,Who?
Saul,"Thank God! I thought...what can I do for you, gentlemen? Anything! Just tell me what you need."
Jesse,"This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000. You should have taken it!"
Saul,Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?
Jesse,Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
Saul,"The uncle. That was your guy? No offense, guys, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know? Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. But I'll take your money! Sure!"
Jesse,"Nah. That offer's expired, yo."
Saul,"It was kind of low anyways. But okay, okay, I'll take it. Just tell me what you need. I'm easy. I'm going to keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic."
Jesse,"All right, listen to me very carefully. You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever. But no deals with the DEA! All right? Badger will not identify anyone to anybody. If he does, you're dead!"
Saul,"Why don't you just k*ll Badger? Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you, it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney. You go grab a flyswatter. I mean, so to speak. I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"
Jesse,"We're not k*ll*ing Badger, yo!"
Saul,"Then you got real problems. 'Cause the DEA is gonna come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks. I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, but he's not gonna like prison. He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me. Mr. Mayhew? I recognize your cough. Take that mask off. Get some air. Go on. Take it easy! Breathe in, breathe out. I'm gonna stand up, all right? 'Cause I got bad knees. That's better. Now listen. The three of us are gonna work this out."
Walter,How?
Saul,"First things first, you're gonna put a dollar in my pocket, both of you. You want attorney-client privilege? So that everything you say is strictly between us. I mean it! Put a dollar in my pocket. Come on, make it official. Come on, do it! That's it. Come on. Just a dollar. All right, now you, ski bum. Come on. Give with the dollar. Go on. Be smart. What?"
Jesse,All I got's a 5.
Saul,"I'll take a 5! Come on, already. Come on. Be cool. You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates. Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment. Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground."
Walter,Do it.
Saul,So if a prison shanking is completely off the table and we're sure of that?
Jesse,No shanking!
Saul,Then the way I see it is somebody's going to prison. It's just a matter of who.
Hank,"All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside, your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty k*ller deal. Time served, no probation. He's pretty slick. Couldn't believe the judge went for it. Don't get cocky. You ain't home free yet. You don't give us the name of your supplier, you're going nowhere."
Saul,"Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary. This young man is cooperating fully."
Hank,Is that right? You cooperating? Let's start with a name.
Badger,He just goes by Heisenberg.
Hank,How old's this Heisenberg?
Badger,Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.
Hank,Height?
Badger,"Average, I guess. Medium height, medium weight."
Hank,What color hair?
Badger,No hair. Dude's balder than you.
Saul,"1963, James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine. 1975, breaking and entering. 1982, grand theft auto. 1984, armed robbery. 1987, 1992. You get the idea. And here he is today. Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out. City, State, and Federal. He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside. An entire life behind bars. Jimmy provides a very special service. For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
Jesse,On purpose? The guy goes to prison on purpose?
Saul,"He's actually more comfortable inside. The outside world hasn't been too kind to him. Sometime during the Clinton administration, Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit."
Walter,When does all this happen?
Saul,"It's already happening. The buy is set for tomorrow. Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy, and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000 and one pound of your finest meth."
Walter,"$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?"
Saul,"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years. I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case. Secondly, he gets 30."
Walter,You get 50? For what?
Saul,"For facilitating. Who's taking a bigger risk? He likes prison. You did bring the cash, didn't you? Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always Badger in the chow line. Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it? All right."
Cop,There's our boy. Right on time.
Jesse,Go back.
Walter,What? All right. So what do you think? Did they see us?
Jesse,I think we're good. Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Walter,Give me those back. Just give them to me! Where the hell is Jimmy? He should have been here ten minutes ago.
Jesse,You think Jimmy's actually for real? A guy who wants to be in prison?
Walter,There's more than one kind of prison.
Jesse,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Walter,Wait a minute.
Jesse,What? What? Let me see. Who the hell is that?
Walter,I don't know.
Cop,"Mr. Heisenberg, I presume. Time to move?"
Hank,Not till we see the exchange.
Jesse,What? Now he shows.
Badger,"Okay, let's do this."
Jesse,Oh my God. Jimmy's on the wrong bench. Crap! We are screwed! What are you doing?
Cop,I don't get it. What's the holdup?
Badger,"Where's the stuff, man?"
Jesse,Where are we going?
Walter,Just shut up. Get out. Go stop him.
Jesse,"The DEA is right there. If they see me, we're screwed."
Walter,Get out. I'll do something.
Jesse,What?
Walter,"Go! Hank, I thought that was you!"
Cop,"Schrader, I'm blocked."
Hank,Not a good time.
Walter,How you doing? Are you feeling okay?
Cop,"Schrader, I'm blocked."
Hank,We're working. You gotta get out of here.
Walter,You're working? Like DEA working? Is something going down?
Jesse,Wrong guy! Wrong guy! Other bench.
Hank,Move your ass now!
Walter,Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.
Hank,We'll talk about it later. Just floor it! Floor it!
Walter,Forward is better? I'll be out of the way then? I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone.
Hank,We'll talk later. Just go.
Cop,Where'd he go? Where the hell'd he go? Wait. Got him. Looks like it's going down. Take 'em!
Walter,I think they bought it.
Cop,"Absolutely. Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir. Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff. And Heisenberg's real name? James Kilkelly. Thank you very much. It was my pleasure."
Jane,"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in. I hope that's okay."
Jesse,Absolutely.
Jane,So you bought a bed. What is that? A king? Pillow top?
Saul,Oh my God. You really are a chemistry teacher. You mind? I was terrible at chemistry. I'm more of a humanities guy.
Walter,How did you find me?
Saul,"We should talk about that. It should be much, much harder for people to track you down. My P. I. charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one."
Walter,"So this is what, blackmail?"
Saul,"Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shake-down racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers."
Walter,"So what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Saul,"Come on. Have you seen my hourly rate? By the way, where do you keep the money? Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar, buried in the side yard? You know, this kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last. And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
Walter,I don't understand. What exactly are you offering to do for me?
Saul,What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
Walter,I'm no Vito Corleone.
Saul,"No shit! Right now, you're Fredo. But with some sound advice and the proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing, you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make ""Better call Saul!"""
Marie,These people. Pathetic. I already read that one anyway. Kleinman has better magazines.
Walter,"You know, you guys really don't need to hang around. We won't even get the results till next week."
Hank,"Buddy, we're going to be here. You kidding me?"
Marie,"It is a full PET/CT, correct? You definitely want the PET/CT and not just the PET."
Skyler,It's a PET/CT.
Marie,"Good. That's what you want. Some places skimp, and they only do the PET. I'm not naming any names, but I just still don't understand why you don't go to Kleinman."
Skyler,This is where Walt's doctor is.
Marie,"With us, you wouldn't have to wait until next week to get the results. I'm sorry, but these scans are not that difficult to read. I could take one look at Walt's and tell you immediately how he's doing. Really. Doctors like people to think that they're so much smarter than the technicians, but you would be surprised how much they come to us for input."
Walter,"Never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom, huh? Excuse me."
Guy,You all right in there? You okay?
Walter,"I'm fine, thank you."
Technician,"Sir, you can go back to your changing room and get dressed."
Walter,"So, how'd we do?"
Technician,You did fine.
Walter,See anything?
Technician,"I'm just a technician, Mr. White. Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results with you next week."
Saul,"Sorry. Actually, the money laundering aspect is fairly straightforward. But I gotta tell ya, the not-telling-your-wife aspect? Most people want to know why they suddenly got rich."
Walter,"If she finds out, it's after I'm gone."
Saul,How much time they giving you?
Walter,Weeks. Maybe.
Saul,"Sorry to hear it. I was hoping we could make some real money together. Oh, well. Let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering?"
Walter,"At this time, $16,000."
Saul,How long have you been doing this?
Walter,We've had some extenuating circumstances.
Saul,"Apparently. All right, 16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes to $9,960. Congratulations. You just left your family a second hand Subaru."
Walter,"We'll just have to cook more, a lot more."
Saul,"Yeah, that's my legal opinion. Make hay while the sun is still shining."
Skyler,"You know, we should do something this weekend. Get our minds off the test results?"
Walter,"Actually, I'm thinking I should go see Mom."
Skyler,Really?
Walter,"You know, I never did call her."
Skyler,You're expecting the news from the scan to be bad. God. I need you to stay positive with me here. I am.
Walter,"Positive is good. I'm all for positive, but positive doesn't change facts. All right? It doesn't change the need to be prepared."
Skyler,"I know. I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay? You know? Forgive me."
Walter,"Look, I need to know Mom's going to leave you something if I'm no longer around. I just need to get that straight. That's all. And believe me, I'm going to earn every penny of it, too. Complaining about her nurses the entire time. ""Juanita is hiding my ashtray."" A 30-minute discourse about how the sugar packets are suddenly disappearing. And, oh, she's counting every one of them. You know? I'll be lucky if I get a word in edgewise."
Skyler,I actually think the news from the scan is going to be good. Perhaps you should prepare for that.
Jane,We should do something.
Jesse,"Yeah, we should."
Jane,"No, something else. We should go somewhere. Have you been to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?"
Jesse,Is that the one with the A-bombs?
Jane,Georgia O'Keeffe. She's a painter. You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?
Jesse,Who is it?
Jane,"Boy, you need some educating."
Jesse,"Yes, I do. Come here."
Jane,Why don't we go up to Santa Fe? We'll make a day of it.
Jesse,You want to go all the way to Santa Fe for a museum?
Jane,"Yep, we're going. Get up."
Jesse,Why can't we just go to the movies or putt-putt? It's the shit.
Jane,"A little culture won't k*ll you. Besides, you might like it. A lot of her paintings look like vaginas."
Jesse,Really?
Jane,Is there still cereal?
Jesse,"Yo, if I know you, leave a message."
Walter,"Where the hell are you? Pick up the phone. Hello, Jesse. Pick up."
Jesse,"Hold on, hold on. Sorry. One sec. What?"
Walter,I've been trying to reach you. Where's your drop phone?
Jesse,I've been busy.
Walter,Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.
Jesse,What? Today?
Walter,"No. You'll need today at least to gather supplies. Now, we're going to need all new glassware, heating mantles, and about a hundred pounds of ice. Do you have a paper and pencil? You should be writing this down."
Jesse,Go shopping yourself. I got plans.
Walter,"Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos, and mastarbating do not constitute plans in my book."
Jesse,"Screw you and your book, man. I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe, not like you need to know."
Walter,You're going to a museum?
Jesse,Georgia O'Keeffe.
Walter,Georgia O’Keeffe?
Jesse,She's a painter? Duh? She does these v*g1n* pictures. Or paintings. Or just painted. I don't know.
Walter,What are you even talking about?
Jesse,"Why am I explaining myself to you? It's none of your damn business what I'm doing. All you need to know is I ain't cooking, shopping or whatever."
Walter,Let me explain something to you. You and I need to cook through to next Tuesday.
Jesse,Tuesday? Four days straight?
Walter,"Like it or not, we have no choice."
Jesse,"And why, exactly, is that?"
Walter,Our methylamine. It's going bad.
Jesse,What?
Walter,"It's losing its chemical potency. Now, unless stealing another barrel sounds good to you."
Jesse,"Hell, no."
Walter,We have to act fast before it goes to waste. You have paper and pencil? Come on.
Jesse,"All right, all right. Go."
Skyler,I wish you didn't have to do this.
Walter,"Me, too. But I'll be back before you know it, and you can always call if you need me."
Skyler,"And risk talking to your mother? That'd have to be some emergency. Love you. Fly safe, okay?"
Walter,You brought a meth lab to the airport?
Jesse,What? You said we were in a hurry. I saved us a trip.
Walter,"Did you get everything? All six? With reflux condensers? Yes, like I said. Just go. Drive. Go, go."
Jesse,"Good morning to you, too, man."
Walter,Three entire bags of Funyuns?
Jesse,What? Funyuns are awesome.
Walter,God.
Jesse,More for me.
Walter,"How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh?"
Jesse,"Man, I'm getting no service."
Walter,How are you even alive?
Jesse,"Yo, check your phone. You get any bars?"
Walter,I've got a signal.
Jesse,"Let me use yours, would ya?"
Walter,Absolutely not. I have to assume Skyler checks my phone records. You know that.
Jesse,It's not business. It's personal.
Walter,"Oh, personal. What, female?"
Jesse,Maybe.
Walter,"Absolutely, that's all I need. Skyler hits ""redial"" and some stripper answers."
Jesse,"Look, she's not a stripper. Okay, dickwad?"
Walter,Sorry. My wife checks. Drinking water? Is that all we've got? Ten gallons?
Jesse,"What, you planning on taking a bath in it?"
Walter,"Oh, God. Not there. That is our work station."
Jesse,Our work station.
Walter,That's right. Why don't you try to find a place where it won't get lost? Considering this is our only set and we are a million miles from nowhere.
Jesse,Why don't you try sticking them up your ass sideways?
Jesse,2.35 pounds.
Walter,2.35.
Jesse,That's the last of it. How many total?
Walter,19.
Jesse,Dollar-wise? How much?
Walter,"Well, median weight 2.2 pounds. That's 41.8, call it 42 pounds at...what are we selling it for these days?"
Jesse,40 a pound.
Walter,"$40,000?"
Jesse,You said raise the prices.
Walter,"All right, that's 40 times 42, minus distribution charges."
Jesse,What? What?
Walter,"$672,000."
Jesse,All that?
Walter,Each.
Jesse,Each?
Walter,Each.
Jesse,Six hundred and...
Walter,Seventy-two thousand dollars each.
Jesse,"Each! Yes! Hell, yeah! Come high, baby! Come on! Yes! Come on! Well, there goes the generator. I think that's it for the gas. Perfect timing, yo."
Walter,How do you figure that?
Jesse,What do you mean? We're done cooking.
Walter,"I am not done until this barrel is empty. Look at that. I'd say we still got 10, 12 gallons of methylamine. Come on, where's your ambition?"
Jesse,"Jesus. Seriously? We are way ahead of schedule. Plus, the genny needs gas, we're almost out of propane, and my back is k*ll*ing me from that piece-of-crap cot. Come on, can we at least just take the night off. Look, I don't have to take you back till Tuesday, right? So we come back tomorrow, strap on the sizzle and glass up the rest. Come on! There's got to be a Denny's out there someplace. Grand Slam? A hot shower? A bed?"
Walter,Separate rooms.
Jesse,That's a given. The battery's dead.
Walter,"Jesse, back when I asked you to put the keys in a safe place, where did you put them?"
Jesse,I left 'em right here in the ignition.
Walter,Son of a bitch.
Jesse,This is not my fault. The buzzer didn't buzz.
Walter,The what?
Jesse,"The buzzer. It buzzes when you put the keys in to let you know that the battery's on. I know that. It didn't buzz. Look, I didn't turn the key or anything. I'm not stupid. Did you hear the buzzer buzz? It's faulty. It's a faulty mechanism."
Walter,Is this a genetic thing with you? Is it congenital? Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby?
Jesse,"The buzzer did not buzz, and you made me move the keys in the first place, remember?"
Walter,"I see your point. Your imbecility being what it is, I should have known to say, ""Jesse, don't leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days!"""
Jesse,"I wanted to leave them on the counter, bitch! Oh, I'm sorry. The work station."
Walter,"All right, so we need to jump the battery somehow."
Jesse,How?
Jesse,You going to be okay?
Walter,Damn it.
Jesse,"What's it taste like? Bad, huh?"
Walter,"This is good. Right here. There. Here. Red to red, black to black. Positive, negative. All right. Start it up."
Jesse,The hell's wrong with this thing?
Walter,You have to really pull.
Jesse,I am.
Walter,Really pull. Not like a girl.
Jesse,"You know what? Pull this. I am pulling. It just needs to warm up a little. Oh, Jesus."
Walter,"Well done. As always. Just, well done."
Jesse,"God. Come on, you bitches. Hear me now. Damn it! This is stupid. Okay, now we have to use your phone."
Walter,This is ruined. Do you understand? Just ruined.
Jesse,I understand you hooked it up wrong and you blew it up.
Walter,That is not what happened.
Jesse,How do you know?
Walter,I wasn't the one who dumped out the last of our water. That's what I know.
Jesse,There was a fire. Excuse me for thinking on my feet.
Walter,"Is that, you were thinking. Now that we have identified the problem. You and thinking, that's the problem."
Jesse,"Look, somebody is going to have to pick us up. Your wife is not going to notice one little call. Mr. White, come on."
Walter,"All right, look. Make it snappy. The roaming drains the battery."
Jesse,"All right. Yo, Skinny, hey. Listen, I need you to come pick us up. Now, all right? We're stuck out here. You got a pen for directions? A pencil's fine, retard. Just something to write with. It doesn't matter. All right, so you ready? So you're going to head west on the 40 for, like, what, 30 miles? And you're just gonna go past the casino with the big arrows in the parking lot. Big arrows, giant arrows. They light up and blink and shit. You can't miss them. But then you're gonna want to take it slow because there's this dirt road right before this white sign with a 3 on it, okay? Now, you're going to be way, way out in the boonies, okay? Like, crazy far, so you just got to keep heading down that dirt road for what?"
Walter,About another 15 miles.
Jesse,Really? That far?
Walter,Hurry up. The battery.
Jesse,"Just go down that road for, like, 15 more miles. I mean, we're way the hell out here. And yo, listen. Bring water. Leave now. Here. He's coming."
Jesse,"There was this guy on the Discovery Channel who broke his leg mountain biking, and he had to drink urine for, you know, just until the forest ranger found him. He said it tasted like really hot, really old soda. We should just call. You know? I'll be quick. Just be like, ""Yo, where are you?"""
Walter,All right.
Jesse,"Come on. Yo, where are you? So you saw the white sign? He's almost here. Oh, man. We're getting really freaked out. All right, so you're on the dirt road? He's on the dirt road. Good. You just crossed the river? Have you seen anything?"
Walter,"Wait, wait. What river? What river? What the hell river you talking about, man? There's no river. Can you...phone's dead. Now what? What now?"
Walter,Come on. Seriously?
Jesse,What's this?
Walter,I'm trying to trickle-charge the battery.
Jesse,Seriously? Just by turning that thing?
Walter,"The commutator. It's the part which generates the electricity. Usually, this little piston engine turns it, but considering it's lying here completely totaled...anyway. Apply a little elbow grease. It'll take longer. A lot longer. But theoretically, it should work."
Jesse,Theoretically.
Walter,It has to work. You understand?
Jesse,Can I try? How much longer?
Walter,I don't know.
Jesse,You hanging in?
Walter,I'm good.
Jesse,It's got to be ready by now. Right?
Walter,"Give it a little longer, just to make sure we're..."
Jesse,"Methylamine doesn't spoil, does it? That's not why we're here. Lie much? Push. Come on. Please. God. Please. Why couldn't I have just gone to Santa Fe? Why? What are you doing?"
Walter,I had this coming.
Jesse,What?
Walter,I have it coming. I deserve this.
Jesse,"You snap out of it. First off, everything you did, you did for your family. Right?"
Walter,All I ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie. God. All the lies. I can't even I can't even keep them straight in my head anymore.
Jesse,You know what? Screw this. I'm walking. You can come or not. Where's my other shoe?
Walter,"Jesse, your body is running dangerously low on electrolytes. Sodium, potassium, calcium. And when they're gone, your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles. Your lungs stop breathing, your heart stops pumping. You go marching out there, and within an hour, you will be dead."
Jesse,You need to cut out all your loser cry-baby crap right now and think of something scientific!
Walter,"Something scientific, right."
Jesse,"What? Come on. You're smart. You made poison out of beans. All right, look. We got an entire lab right here. All right? How about you take some of these chemicals and mix up some rocket fuel? That way, you can just send up a signal flare. Or you make some kind of robot to get us help, or a homing device or build a new battery or...wait. No. What if we just take some stuff off of the RV and build it into something completely different? Like a dune buggy. That way, we can just dune buggy...What is it? What?"
Walter,"Do you have any money? Change, I mean. Coins."
Jesse,I got a bunch of them.
Walter,Then gather them. And washers and nuts and bolts and screws and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized. It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.
Jesse,"Solid zinc, right."
Walter,And bring me brake pads. The front wheels should have discs. Take them off and bring them to me.
Jesse,Brake pads. What are we building?
Walter,You said it yourself.
Jesse,A robot?
Walter,A battery. Move!
Jesse,This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
Walter,"Well, trust me. It is a battery. Or rather, one cell of a battery. Here. Cut up the last two sponges. Remember the electrolytes? Think about it. A battery is a galvanic cell. It's no more than an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte, right?"
Jesse,Right.
Walter,"Well, anyway. On one side, we have mercuric oxide and graphite from your brake pads. This is the cathode. This is the positive terminal. This is where the supply of current flows out from. You see? Then, here, I'll show you. On the opposite side is our anode. This, it's zinc. It's what we find in our coins and anything galvanized."
Jesse,"So, the sponge is the electrolyte?"
Walter,"No, the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte. But yes, that's what I'm soaking the sponges in. Good. Good. And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with? What one particular element comes to mind?"
Jesse,A wire.
Walter,Copper.
Jesse,"Well, I mean..."
Walter,It's copper. The only question now is will this supply enough current? And how many cells will we need? Maybe we've only got enough material for six. Put the lid on. Wait. Positive. Cathode. Anode. Damn. That is good. That's very good. Here we go.
Jesse,How's the...
Walter,It's fine. I know I can trust you to…
Jesse,"Yeah. Whatever happens, your family will get your share. So I'll be hearing from you."
Dr. Delcavoli,"How's everyone doing? Is that baby ever going to come out, you think?"
Skyler,I know enough already. It's…
Dr. Delcavoli,"I'm teasing. Everything in its time. Walt, I have your scan results. And you're showing signs of remission."
Marie,My God.
Dr. Delcavoli,"I want to clarify. There are some misconceptions about what remission signifies. It does not mean that the patient is cured. To classify someone as in remission, we only need to determine that the tumor hasn't grown."
Hank,That it hasn't grown? Jesus.
Dr. Delcavoli,"Technically speaking, a tumor can remain the exact same size it was before and the patient could still be in remission. Now, in Walt's case, with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma, I like to see, I hope to see at least a 25 to 35% reduction in tumor mass, something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy. Everybody still with me?"
Walter,And how has my cancer responded?
Dr. Delcavoli,Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.
Walter,My God.
Skyler,"Wait, I'm sorry. I'm really confused. Isn't 80% a lot?"
Walter Jr,Mom.
Skyler,"Okay, but, I'm…"
Walter,"Sweetheart, you were right. It's very good news. It's very good news."
Skyler,Are you kidding me?
Hank,"Just when I try to get out, they pull me back in."
Dr. Delcavoli,"Now, that cough is the other thing we need to discuss. According to your scan, Walt, you have radiation pneumonitis. It's okay. This is fairly common. See that scary-looking thing there? That's tissue inflammation. That's a reaction to your radio therapy. It's usually not serious, but it can produce a cough like that. I'll prescribe some prednisone."
Walter,"Tissue inflammation? Are you sure about that? Because the other day, I was coughing up some blood."
Skyler,What?
Dr. Delcavoli,"You probably have a tear in your esophagus from the coughing, and that can be very serious. You could rupture and bleed to death. We're going to have to deal with that before you leave here today."
Skyler,Wait a minute. When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?
Walter,I'm sorry. I…
Dr. Delcavoli,"No more secrets, Walt. With something like this, you have to call me. Immediately. Now, with these results, we're not completely out of the woods. But now at least we have some options. The most important of which is time. We'll have more to discuss in the next few weeks. But for now, I'd say that you folks have earned some celebrating."
Skyler,"You're not thinking about going to work today, are you?"
Walter,Thought I would. That inhaler really seems to be doing the trick. What?
Skyler,"Just take the rest of the week. Please. You've earned it. Don't push it. Besides, I want you well for the weekend."
Walter Jr,Mom wants to par-tay.
Skyler,"It's just a little get-together, that's all. Sunday afternoon, maybe? Nothing too big. Just family and a few friends. We've got a lot to celebrate. Don't you think?"
Walter,Sounds good.
Skyler,"Now, what are you supposed to do today?"
Walter,Nothing.
Skyler,Excellent. Brownie points for taking a nap.
Walter,Can you meet?
Jesse,"I thought maybe you might have, you know, kicked. Signed off. I was even checking the obits."
Walter,No such luck.
Jesse,"So where does it stand? Coughing up blood, giving speeches like, ""I deserve this. I'm an assh*le."" What's the upshot?"
Walter,The upshot. The upshot is that I have radiation pneumonitis.
Jesse,Damn.
Walter,"Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's a fairly common occurrence, easily treated. In fact, the news is all good."
Jesse,"What do you mean, good? You mean, like, good good? You mean, like, remission good?"
Walter,Remission. Not to imply I'm cured. I still have cancer. But there's been a significant reduction in the tumors.
Jesse,How significant?
Walter,80%.
Jesse,Dude! No way!
Walter,"Now, I'm not out of the woods yet, not by any stretch, but ""options"" is the word they keep bandying about."
Jesse,"That's awesome! Serious? That's great, man. I mean, my aunt, she never I mean, at your stage, I didn't think that could happen. Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo! You must be so psyched."
Walter,"Of course. I am. Now we. I mean, what do we..."
Jesse,"I almost forgot. So, how do you want to, you know, proceed in light of this kick-ass news?"
Walter,We'll take our time and stay cautious. Sell off what we have. And then I guess I'm done.
Skyler,"Everyone? Hey, you guys. I would like to make a toast, with my non-alcoholic beverage."
Hank,Somebody k*ll the music.
Skyler,"I know one party can't begin to repay all your support and your many, many kindnesses. But then again, Hank does make one mean margarita. We really do want to thank you. These last few months have been a challenging time, to put it mildly. But I have to say Walt's come through it like a champ. Honey, I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff. But it's true. It really is. And for the first time in a long time, we are so excited about the future. Anyway, I want to also express my gratitude to two very special people who couldn't be here today. But they send their regrets and their warm wishes. Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz, for those of you who don't know them are well, they're heroes. They are incredibly generous friends who made the amazing offer to pay for Walt's treatment. And they did. So to Gretchen and Elliott."
Hank,How about the man of the hour? Come on!
Walter,"It's kind of funny. When I got my diagnosis, cancer, I said to myself, ""Why me?"" And then, the other day, when I got the good news I said the same thing. Anyway, thank you for coming. Enjoy. Cheers."
Hank,"Tell you what. I gotta give those bastards points for originality. I'll tell you that much. A little mercury switch, that's how those cartel boys party."
Walter Jr,But why a turtle?
Hank,"That's the best part. It was a, what the hell's the word I'm looking for? Not a metaphor, not an analogy. It's a, what's the word I'm looking for? Anyway, ""Tortuga."" That was the name of our snitch. Bean-speak for ""tortoise."" Tortoise, turtle, what have you I never knew the difference myself. Top me off there, will you, buddy? Anyway, poetic. I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic. That's the word. I guess that's the word."
Walter,Go ahead.
Hank,Better not let your mom see. I think I see a hair. Maybe two!
Walter Jr,"There's no worm in this, right?"
Hank,"That would be Mescal. Talk about your hangovers, okay? I was down in Glynco, Georgia. I was back east, doing some training. Had this firearm instructor who was, he was a good ol' boy. There you go. Thanks. I mean, this guy could put 'em away like he had two livers, okay? Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish. We were drinking Mescal stupid. But...what are you doing there?"
Walter,What does it look like I'm doing?
Hank,"The kid's 16. What are you, going for Father of the Year?"
Walter,What are you looking at him for? We're celebrating. Come on.
Hank,"Listen, I'd take a pass on that one if I were you, okay? Think we've been bogarting this puppy long enough."
Walter,Bring the bottle back.
Hank,"Sorry, buddy. No can do."
Walter,My son! My bottle! My house!
Hank,It's all right.
Walter,What are you waiting for? Bring it back.
Hank,"Why don't we just call it a day? All right, pal? We good?"
Walter,The bottle. Now.
Skyler,"What's going on? Here, sweetie."
Jesse,This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. You weren't supposed to wake up.
Jane,Ever or?
Jesse,"I was just thinking that I'd bring it, you know, in."
Jane,You want me to go back to bed?
Jesse,I guess that'd be kind of...
Jane,Need some help?
Jesse,I got it. Just have a seat.
Jane,Is there any coffee?
Jesse,"Yeah, shit. One second."
Jane,At least let me do that.
Jesse,"I don't want you to have to do anything, you know? All right. Here. You take the good one. It's huevos rancheros."
Jane,I can tell. Fork?
Jesse,There you go.
Jane,So what are you up to today? Working? Whatever that means.
Jesse,Nope. I'm all yours.
Jane,Really?
Skyler,"Hey, this is Skyler. Please leave me a message. Thanks."
Walter,"I just wanted to say that, we'll talk tonight, but I wanted to say that I'm not exactly sure who that was yesterday, but it wasn't me. I'm sorry. Love you."
Ted,"Hey, there. Who brought the churros?"
Skyler,"That would be me. If I leave 'em at home, I'll wind up eating them all myself, so. They're actually leftovers. We had a little get-together for Walt."
Ted,"It wasn't his birthday, was it?"
Skyler,"Actually, Walt's got, he's been battling cancer. And last week, we got good news."
Ted,I'm so sorry.
Skyler,But we're really optimistic.
Ted,Great. Good news is great.
Skyler,"Yeah, it is. It really is."
Ted,Feel free to bring these any time.
Employee,Got some real beauts.
Walter,"You cannot beat the thermal efficiency of the C3. Then again, what about tankless?"
Employee,"Sure. We got 'em. The good ones will really run up your price though. Set you back about 1,200."
Walter,It's not an issue.
Employee,"You want installation, right?"
Walter,No. I'm gonna do it myself.
Employee,That's what I like to hear.
Jane,And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?
Jesse,"That's Hover Man. He can surf, skate, glide, whatever, 'cause he's always got a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet."
Jane,That's cool. Great lines. And this guy? What's his superpower?
Jesse,That's Kanga Man.
Jane,"Kanga Man. Half man, half kangaroo? And who's this in his pouch?"
Jesse,"His sidekick Joey. He rides around in his pouch and, you know, fights crime."
Jane,"So that makes Kanga-man a she. You know that, right? Only female kangaroos have pouches."
Jesse,"I know. But, you know, it's definitely a dude. He's a product of experimentation."
Jane,"He's kind of hot, I guess. Nice haunches. And this is?"
Jesse,"It's Backwardo. Wait, no. I actually changed it to Rewindo. Anyways, he goes backwards. He can make everything go in reverse."
Jane,Time and stuff? Like time traveling?
Jesse,"No, he just walks backwards."
Jane,He walks backwards. Is that a superpower? What good is that?
Jesse,"He does it, like, really fast. Look, say someone's coming at him with a knife. Right? It's helpful. Then he can just zip backwards away from 'em. I was a kid when I drew all these. It was, like, four years ago."
Jane,They all look like you.
Jesse,What?
Jane,It's you in all of these. I wonder what a shrink would say if he saw them.
Jesse,Shut up. Like you never wanted a superpower.
Jane,Is that your door or mine?
Jesse,I don't know.
Jane,It sounds like mine. I gotta go.
Jesse,Where? Where? Hold up. Where are you...
Jane,"Hey, Dad."
Donald,"There you are. Hi, honey. I saw your car, so I was pretty sure you were home."
Jane,Sorry. I was working. I had my headphones on.
Donald,Finally realized that I wasn't the drum track?
Jane,Exactly.
Donald,I was in the neighborhood. Was wondering if you wanted to grab some lunch.
Jane,Sure.
Jesse,Hey. This your dad?
Jane,This is the new tenant.
Donald,Donald.
Jesse,Jesse.
Jane,"I'm sorry. Did you need something? Dad, why don't you come in? It was nice seeing you."
Donald,It was nice to meet you.
Jesse,"You, too."
Walter Jr,"Hey, Dad."
Walter,"Hey, son. Are you home early? Oh, man. Did you have a good day?"
Walter Jr,"Now it is. Finally, hot water. No more toxic waste."
Walter,"Yes, indeed. Top-of-the-line, on demand, unlimited supply."
Walter Jr,Sweet.
Walter,"Want to take her for a spin? Listen, why don't you go to the kitchen sink? Let me know when you're ready, and I'll give you a holler. The pilot in. Ignition. Bingo."
Walter Jr,Ready!
Walter,"All right. Let her rip! Built-in corrosion resistant draft reducer, safety thermocouple at the pilot burner."
Walter Jr,"Sounds really good, Dad."
Walter,"And the energy savings. I mean….oh, careful, careful, careful. There's probably some adjustments I need to make there. Are you okay?"
Walter Jr,I'm fine.
Walter,"Son, about yesterday..."
Walter Jr,I'm sorry about the pool.
Walter,"No. That was not your fault. Not at all. Your old man embarrassed himself, and I'm not very proud of my behavior. I have to say I feel very foolish."
Walter Jr,"You and Uncle Hank, you seemed pissed off."
Walter,"We're fine. Everything's fine. I called him this morning and made my apologies. But, son, I owe you an apology most of all. I should have used better judgment all around. Having you drink in the first place, it was not right, and for that I'm very sorry."
Walter Jr,"But I kept up, right? You and Uncle Hank. I drank three."
Walter,I have some tools to put away.
Jane,You want to catch a movie later? What?
Jesse,What was that all about?
Jane,What?
Jesse,Before. With your dad.
Jane,It wasn't about anything.
Jesse,So I totally just misread your total dis?
Jane,"If anything, I was doing you a favor."
Jesse,A favor?
Jane,I told you. He's a hard-ass.
Jesse,He seemed cool to me.
Jane,"Yeah, well…"
Jesse,So what's the deal?
Jane,"There's no deal. I was helping you out, okay? Protecting you."
Jesse,How's that?
Jane,"I mean, I'm letting you smoke in here and everything."
Jesse,I bought a filter.
Jane,"And I figured the less he knows, the better."
Jesse,You acted like you didn't even know me.
Jane,So?
Jesse,So?
Jane,"You think I'm going to be all like, ""Dad, meet the stoner guy who lives next door. And by the way, I'm sleeping with him?”"
Jesse,That's all you think you're doing?
Jane,Why do you even care about my dad?
Jesse,I don't!
Jane,Good. Then I don't know why we're talking about it.
Jesse,Us. All right? I'm talking about us.
Jane,Us?
Jesse,You and me.
Jane,Who's you and me?
Jesse,I'm out of here.
Walter Jr,Dad! Dad?
Walter,What?
Walter Jr,What are you doing?
Walter,We've got rot.
Walter Jr,Rot?
Walter,I'll show you. Here. Take a look at that. See that? Ever seen anything like it?
Walter Jr,It's wood.
Walter,It's wood that contains fruiting bodies.
Walter Jr,Fruity what?
Walter,Fungus. And it is on a rampage.
Walter Jr,I don't really see anything.
Walter,"Well, it's there. You just have to know where to look. Here. Then you cut it all out. You just cut it out and start fresh. Well, better get to it."
Walter Jr,Is the whole house gonna collapse or something?
Walter,Not if I can help it.
Ted,You bucking for a promotion? Go home already.
Skyler,I will. Can I just ask the Keller account.
Ted,Keller account?
Skyler,"It's listed as a Current Asset on this balance sheet, but the invoice was never presented to Accounts Receivable, so."
Ted,"God. One of these days I'm going to have to sort through all the Dad stuff. He had so many ""Don't worry about it, pay me Friday"" relationships with these little companies. We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not."
Skyler,Right.
Ted,"Seriously, you're not gonna make me lock you in, are you?"
Skyler,Jesus. I'm fine. It's hormones. Honestly. It happens all the time. I'll see you tomorrow.
Ted,What's wrong?
Skyler,I guess it just doesn't feel any different.
Ted,The good news?
Skyler,"I mean, nothing's really changed. It's just postponed. There was supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel. But lately, it just feels like..."
Ted,More tunnel.
Skyler,I'm sorry. I just feel so damn ungrateful. I don't know.
Ted,"For me, it was the flu."
Skyler,What?
Ted,"My dad rallied at the end. I mean, it wasn't the full-on good news Walt got, different circumstances, but we were happy, we were over the moon. And right then, I got sick. Flu. Boom. Knocked me on my ass for days. Couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move. Great timing. And I wasn't even putting two and two together. I was just thinking, Why now? Being that rock, being that rock takes everything you got."
Skyler,Are you going to work today?
Walter,"Skyler, there's rot."
Skyler,Damn! Clumsy.
Ted,I got it.
Skyler,You don't have to do that.
Walter,You're buying the wrong matches.
Drug Dealer,What?
Walter,"Those matches. They're the wrong kind. Red phosphorus is found in the striker strips, not the matches themselves. You need to get the big 200-count box of individual matchbooks. More striker strips. You understand? Those only have the one. And don't buy everything in one place. Do it piecemeal. Different items, different stores. Attracts less attention. Are you following me here?"
Drug Dealer,There he is. That's the guy.
Walter,Stay out of my territory.
Combo,"What's up? What you need? Yo, you buyin', or are you just stopping to envy? Punk bitches. Bounce, little man. Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine, getting eyeballed hard. I got a bad feeling, man. I need some backup. Get your ass up here now."
Tomas,What's that thing in your ear?
Combo,What did I say? Get out of here! What are you waiting for? Go!
Dr. Delcavoli,We've made such headway with your treatments that now it's time we talked about sealing the deal.
Dr. Bravenec,Absolutely.
Dr. Delcavoli,"As you know, my initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable. That may no longer be the case. We think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option. Maybe a pretty good option. Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country performing lobectomies after full-dosage radiation. He's got a good track record."
Dr. Bravenec,Pretty good.
Skyler,It sounds aggressive.
Dr. Bravenec,"Yes. Very much so. Understand that if you don't have this surgery, you're just waiting for the cancer to spread. And it will. Now, through the treatment you've had already, we've bought you some time. Maybe a lot, probably a little, but that's all. In my opinion, if you're willing to take some risk, then this offers the best chance."
Walter,How much would it cost?
Dr. Bravenec,"I'm not on your insurance. I'd say between 170,000 and 200,000, all in. For my part, I'd be willing to write off what I can, but mine isn't even the biggest expense. This is obviously a big decision. And you folks are gonna want to take some time to discuss it."
Walter,I'll do it.
Skyler,Don't you think we should at least talk this through first?
Walter,I just think it's the way to go.
Dr. Delcavoli,"I have to say I think it's the right choice. I recommend that we let the pneumonitis heal for another couple of weeks, and then we'll have at it."
Walter,That's tricky.
Dr. Bravenec,When's the due date?
Skyler,It's the 21st.
Dr. Bravenec,"I'll book the surgery for four weeks from now. That way, Walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter. But I wouldn't wait any longer."
Jesse,"God. It's me. Where the hell were you? I called, like, 20 times."
Walter,Working. What is it?
Jesse,Combo's dead. sh*t.
Walter,Which one is he?
Jesse,You did not just say that to me.
Walter,"Jesse, listen…"
Jesse,"Yeah, figures. What's the word on the street?"
Skinny Pete,"No one's dropping no names. Combo rang me before it went down. Said dudes were mad-dogging him, trying to run him up off the corner. That's all I know. Why'd we have to go pushing into new turf, yo? I mean, what'd you expect?"
Jesse,I don't know.
Skinny Pete,You don't know? Is that all you got?
Jesse,I'll do right by Combo's people. Make sure you bust up your cell and toss it. We'll figure it out.
Skinny Pete,"I appreciate what you're saying and all, but with Combo gone and Badger laying low out in Cali I'm on probation, man. Fast track to Los Lunas."
Jesse,"We're on the verge of making some serious coin. What, you're gonna jump ship now?"
Skinny Pete,"This game we playing, we don't got the street cred to survive it. Back when everyone thought you k*lled Spooge, maybe we were doing okay, but that whole thing to the head thing, the ATM? His junkie bitch copped to it. The whole town knows it wasn't you."
Jesse,Everyone knows? Why didn't you say something?
Skinny Pete,"I don't know, man. 'Cause we like you and all."
Jesse,"I'm telling you, just sit tight. We'll get by. We'll make it."
Skinny Pete,"Sorry, Jesse. I'm out."
Walter,"We have had a bit of a setback. Sorry, that's an accurate description. What else do you want me to call it?"
Jesse,How about your fault? How about that?
Walter,Don't lay that on me. You are in charge of distribution.
Jesse,You said expand the territory!
Walter,That doesn't mean you become careless!
Saul,"Guys, guys! Who do I look like, Maury Povich? I'm not your marriage counselor. Now, you're professionals. Act like it. Now, setback. Go."
Walter,"One of our dealers was m*rder*d. It was some kind of turf dispute, and apparently we lost. And then everyone quit on us. We have absolutely no distribution."
Saul,"Is there any way any of this can be traced back to you? Now, the police, I'm talking about. There's your silver lighting. How about you? How's the health situation?"
Walter,It's better. Do you mind? Better? It's looking a little more positive. I may have more time than I thought.
Saul,"Outstanding. Now, as to your dead guy, occupational hazard. Drug dealer getting sh*t, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's been known to happen. Now, what about product on hand? How's your inventory?"
Jesse,38 and change.
Saul,38 ounces? Grams?
Jesse,Pounds.
Walter,You did say make hay while the sun is shining.
Saul,Guys! Why the long faces here? You're sitting on a gold mine.
Walter,"A gold mine we can't sell. We need a proper infrastructure. We need foot soldiers and dealers on a street level that are rock solid. We need muscle, and we need enforcers. Payback. That's what we need. God. I mean, this entire process has just been so, it's always been one step forward and two steps back. We need your help."
Saul,"Let's start with some tough love, all right? Ready for this? Here goes. You two suck at peddling meth. Period. So give up on trying to do it all yourselves. Hell, I'm amazed you got this far."
Walter,"Look, we are not going to deal with another high-level distributor. No, thank you. We have been down that road."
Saul,"What? Some tattooed speed-freak? What you two need is an honest-to-God businessman. Somebody who treats your product like the simple high-margin commodity that it is. Somebody who ships out of town, deals only in bulk. Someone who's been doing this for 20 years and never been caught."
Walter,You know someone like that?
Saul,"Let's just say I know a guy who knows a guy. Who knows another guy. Let me make some calls, see if I can get you a meeting."
Walter,"Well, what's his name?"
Saul,"I have no idea. He's very low profile. He's careful like that. From what I do hear about him, he sounds a little like you."
Jesse,"I need you to leave. Look, there's some stuff about me you don't know, and..."
Jane,"Like you're a drug dealer? I kind of got that. You pay in cash, and you use an alias, so."
Jesse,"One of my guys, a friend who worked for me got m*rder*d. It was my fault. I put him on that corner. I'm gonna smoke some crystal, and I just think you should go, being that you're in a program and all and..."
Jane,You could come with me to a meeting.
Jesse,No meetings.
Jane,We could just get out of here. It won't help.
Jesse,"Yeah, it will. And I don't need you telling me that it won't. I just...alright, I really just need you to go."
Walter,You're late.
Jesse,We're in the big time now. So where's the kingpin?
Walter,Your guess is as good as mine.
Jesse,"So you get the dude's name? So let me get this straight. He's allowed to know all our names, what we look like, but not the other way around?"
Walter,Why don't you get yourself some food?
Jesse,"So we won't both sit here with our Happy Meals, looking like a couple chumps?"
Gustavo,"Gentlemen, is everything to your satisfaction?"
Walter,"Fine, thanks."
Jesse,"This is nothing but an ankle-grab. I don't get you, man. A week ago you talked like you were all ready to hang it up."
Walter,We've nearly got 40 pounds we still need to sell.
Jesse,"What about after? After you're gonna make up some new magic number? Like, ""I got bills. I got bills. I gotta make more."""
Walter,"What do you want me to say, Jesse? Things have changed."
Jesse,"Oh, I know. We got a guy k*lled. You know what? This is bullshit. I'm out of here."
Doctor,I think she's waking up from a nap. She is certainly going to want to get out and stretch those legs soon. We'll keep an eye on your fluids. You're on the low side of normal.
Skyler,What? How low?
Doctor,"It's not a problem unless we see a growth drop-off, so we're good. We'll just have you in for an ultrasound next week and keep an eye on things."
Walter,"Oh, man, you would not believe the traffic."
Skyler,That's why I left 40 minutes early.
Walter,Sorry. What did I miss?
Doctor,For your refrigerator.
Walter,"Oh, my God. Look at her. Look. God."
Skyler,It's like she's here already.
Doctor,"I was just telling Skyler everything looks great. Okay, we've been talking about it for months now. It's time to make a decision. You know what I'm going to say?"
Skyler,The C-section?
Doctor,"And if it's a yes, we need to schedule it."
Skyler,"My last labor was pretty tough, so. For the baby, I say yes."
Doctor,"I agree, considering that your fluids are on the low side. It's best we take her a little early. So why don't we schedule it for a week from Friday?"
Skyler,Isn't that Friday the 13th?
Walter,We have a birthday.
Skyler,"The 16th. I like it. You know, speaking of birthdays, I've got to run back to the office, so I will see you later?"
Walter,It's an hour before closing. You're supposed to be taking it easy.
Skyler,We're having a little get-together for Ted's birthday and I've got to pick up the cake.
Walter,Why you?
Skyler,Because I said I would. It's the least I can do.
Jesse,"Let's get out of here. You know, go do something. Seriously. You know that museum in Santa Fe you talked about? Let's take a drive."
Jane,Sure.
Ted,"No, I cannot return that stock. It's already been drilled and cut. We're halfway through the job."
Intercom,"Mr. Beneke to the shop, please."
Ted,"All right. Just let me think about it, okay? I gotta go. Dean, I gotta go."
Everyone,Happy Birthday!
Ted,"My God. This is beautiful, guys. Thank you very much."
Employee,Hurry. These candles aren't gonna hold out much longer.
Skyler,Wait a minute. Are you making a wish? You gotta make a wish.
Ted,"Well, let's see. The economy's in the toilet. China's undercutting us at every turn. I'm at a loss. Wait. I want to hear it first."
Skyler,Absolutely not. No way.
Ted,You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.
Skyler,"Yes, I can. Watch me."
Ted,Please!
Skyler,"If this is your birthday wish, I feel very, very sorry for you."
Ted,Come on. It was so good last time.
Skyler,"It was ages ago. And I'm enormous now. And I don't look anything like her anymore. Not that I ever did. I mean, come on."
Employee,"You guys, these candles are getting wax all over the place. Seriously."
Ted,"Yes, come on, Skyler."
Skyler,It's obscene. Happy Birthday To you Happy Birthday To you Happy Birthday Mr. President Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated Happy Birthday To you.
Ted,"That was fantastic. Isn't she great, huh? Okay, here we go."
Walter,He wasn't there.
Saul,He was there all right.
Walter,What are you talking about? I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.
Saul,All I know is my contact says he was there. Are you sure you were at the right restaurant?
Walter,"Yes, I'm positive. Where was he?"
Saul,"Who knows? Maybe he stayed out in the parking lot, checked you out with a telephoto lens. Didn't like the cut of your jib. Anyway, it doesn't matter now because my contact says it's a no go."
Walter,What? What do you mean?
Saul,"No deal. No dice. sh*t at and missed, shit on and hit."
Walter,Wait a minute. How can he make that decision without even meeting me?
Saul,"I told you he's very cautious who he does business with. All right? He's skittish, like a deer."
Walter,Call him back.
Saul,I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Walter,"Yes, you can. Call him, Saul."
Saul,"First of all, I never called him, all right? I called a guy who called a guy who called a guy. Second of all, it's over. Understand? With this particular individual, all you get is the one sh*t. Look, I'll see if I can scrape something else together, but don't get your hopes up. No one else handles that kind of bulk."
Walter,Damn it.
Gustavo,"Can I help you, sir?"
Walter,"Diet Coke, please. And five minutes of your time."
Gustavo,What can I do for you?
Walter,Have a seat. Please. I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.
Gustavo,I'm sorry. I'm not following.
Walter,"I sat here yesterday, waiting to meet with someone. I believe that person was you."
Gustavo,I think that you're confusing me for someone else.
Walter,I don't think I am.
Gustavo,"Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our email system. I would be happy to refer you to our website."
Walter,"I was told that the man I would be meeting with is very careful. A cautious man. I believe we're alike in that way. If you are who I think you are, you should give me another chance."
Gustavo,"I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late, and he was high."
Walter,"Yes, he was."
Gustavo,"He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgment. I can't work with someone with poor judgment."
Walter,Are you familiar with my product?
Gustavo,I've been told it's excellent.
Walter,"It is impeccable. It is the purest, most chemically-sound product on the market anywhere. That is not the only factor. You could charge twice the current rate for what I provide, and your customers would pay it. Hands down. Now, who I choose to do business with on my end is not your problem. You won't see him. You won't interact with him. Forget he exists."
Gustavo,I have to ask. Why? Why him?
Walter,Because he does what I say. Because I can trust him.
Gustavo,How much product do you have on hand?
Walter,38 pounds. Ready to go at a moment's notice. Will I hear from you?
Gustavo,I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict.
Skyler,"Look, I mean, it's all kind of little dribs and drabs, but right here, take Keller, for instance. A couple hundred dollars here, a few thousand there."
Ted,Dribs and drabs.
Skyler,"Once you add it all up, though, and with Keller, the revenues are almost 10% less than was actually received. And this is every quarter, for the last two years. When I saw that, I got worried, so I checked Accounts Receivable on other customers. I found six other instances of revenues being under-reported. And I've only just started to look into it."
Ted,"We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies. They anticipate their needs for the next quarter. Most of the time, they overestimate. So I just let them roll their overages into the next order and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere. Obviously, we forgot or didn't go back and adjust the revenue entries. I know it's wrong from an accounting standpoint, but as you can see, the money's coming in. Eventually, as you can see."
Skyler,"Right. Right, but I got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage, to try and sort this out. And most of the time, there's no backup for the reported revenues at all. In a few cases, I found Xeroxed copies with the dates changed."
Ted,All right. You got me.
Skyler,We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue. What are you thinking?
Ted,"I'm thinking about saving a company. I'm thinking about people's jobs, about their mortgages and pensions and their college funds for their kids. Not to mention my own."
Skyler,It doesn't mean that you have to break the law.
Ted,"Yes, it does. It's right there in the books. Business is terrible. The bank is on my back, the IRS is grinding me down to a nub. If I don't keep up..."
Skyler,People go to prison for this.
Ted,My dad built this company from nothing. We make things here. The people who work here are like family. I can't let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years. Don't report this. Please.
Skyler,I'm not gonna turn you in. But I can't be a part of it.
Ted,"I know. I know. I just wish, I'm sorry. I don't want you to go."
Jesse,"Yo, if I know you, leave a message."
Skinny Pete,"Yo, it's Skinny Pete. Just checking in with you, man. We missed you at the funeral today. The whole crew was representing. Even Badger came all the way from Fresno. Combo's people, his ma, grandma, cousins, everyone was all choked up and shit. Man, it was, like, emotional. And you should have seen the coffin. It was like this shiny, white pearlescent. Like, I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact same paint job on a Lexus. So we're definitely talking high-end. Anyway, guess you had something bigger going down. Watch your back out there, bro. Peace."
Jane,I like to mix some ice with it. Hold that.
Jesse,What's it feel like?
Jane,There's a chill. Don't freak out. It passes. And then you'll see. I'll meet you there. Take that off.
Walter,"Phones off, please. Pipes, I guess. All right, everyone. Eyes on your paper. Eyes on your paper."
Walter,"Excuse me, where's the manager?"
Cynthia,I'm the manager. Can I help you?
Walter,I met a man here last week. A black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.
Cynthia,"Yes, sir. That's the owner."
Walter,Owner.
Cynthia,He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants in between here and Nevada. He could be at any one of them.
Walter,Is there a phone number that I can get to?
Cynthia,"I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out. Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy to refer you to our website."
Walter,What's his name?
Cynthia,Gustavo. Gus.
Victor,"38 pounds. $1.2 million. Truck stop, 2 miles south of Exit 13. One hour."
Walter,What?
Victor,One hour. You in or out?
Walter,In. In. Absolutely. But I just need a little more time.
Victor,"One hour. If you miss it, don't ever show your face in here again."
Walter,Come on! Come on!
Jesse,"Yo, if I know you, leave a message."
Walter,"Jesse, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone! I'm coming by. I need the product. I need the product now!"
Walter,Jesse! Wake up! Wake up. Where'd you put it? Where is it? Where's the product?
Jesse,Get off of me.
Walter,Where is it? Where'd you hide the meth?
Jesse,In the kitchen.
Walter,Where?
Jesse,Under the sink.
Walter,"Oh no. No, not now! Not now!"
Walter,"Skyler, I'm so...Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...oh, God. Oh, thank God. Is she beautiful? I'm staring at brake lights on the 40. Some accident up ahead. Christ. Today of all days, huh? No, let her rest. I'll be there as soon as I can."
Walter,"Excuse me. Skyler White? Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...are you okay?"
Skyler,Meet your daughter.
Walter,"Hi, there, girl. Hi, there, Holly."
Ted,"Congratulations, Walt."
Walter,"I'm sorry, I didn't see you here."
Skyler,"Ted drove me here. Thank God. I mean, this little bundle of joy of ours was practically on rails. Halfway here I thought he was gonna have to pull over and deliver her himself."
Walter,"Then, I'm glad it didn't come to that."
Ted,"No problem at all. Well, let me get out of your way here so you two can, you three, can be alone, okay? Listen, take it easy, Sky."
Skyler,"I really, I can't begin to thank you."
Ted,Don't think anything of it. It's my pleasure. Congratulations again. She's beautiful. I'll talk to you soon. Take care.
Walter,Are you okay? Is everything okay?
Skyler,Everything's okay. I just wish you'd been here.
Walter,Where's everyone else?
Skyler,Downstairs. Hank and Marie took Junior for dinner. He has been such a trooper. He even changed his first diaper.
Walter,"Did he? Honey, is there anything that I can do for you? Anything at all?"
Skyler,"Actually, yes. I left my overnight bag at home this morning. I think you get it in your head, ""C-section."" You know? But I'm just so glad the way it all worked out. Doing it natural instead. It just couldn't have gone any better."
Walter,"Good. Let me go get your things. And I'll get my stuff, too, okay? I'll spend the night."
Jane,"Dad. I was in the shower. I overslept. I'm running late, but I'll be there. Baby, I gotta go. Somebody broke in."
Jesse,"Okay. No! Come on. Damn. Oh, God. Oh, Christ."
Guy,This week was tough. Toughest yet. You know why? I knew this day was coming. My birthday.
Counselor,Your re-birthday?
Guy,"Yeah, and as it got closer, it got worse. I was scared shitless I wouldn't make it. I really didn't think I would. Called in sick three days in a row. I know my boss was pissed. I guess I don't really care. I just didn't want to see anybody. You guys know how that is. All it'd take is one friend and I'd be out rippin' and runnin' again. But I made it. I really made it. I got one year clean to the day."
Donald,You look tired. Your eyes are kind of red. You getting enough sleep?
Jane,"Actually, no. I'm working on this really complex new tat. A guy wants his whole back done up. Him on his chopper, flames all around. I keep showing him the design and he keeps asking for changes, like, ""Give me more muscles. Give me more flames."" And I'm like, ""A, this ain't the Sistine Chapel. And B, I have enough trouble working around your zits."""
Donald,I really wish you wouldn't work at that place. You need to avoid those types of...
Jane,"I know and I do. It's mostly college kids and airmen from Kirtland. It's actually really corporate. So, how's your job?"
Donald,"Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Doing backup training on my days off. God, they're hiring anybody now. No experience at all. It's scary. You seeing anyone?"
Jane,No. You?
Donald,What about that guy next door?
Jane,What do you mean?
Donald,"Well, he seemed to have some expectation of you introducing me to him."
Jane,"He knows you own the place. Dad, he's our tenant. End of story. Why would I get involved with a tenant?"
Marie,Isn't she beautiful? I just think she's the most beautiful baby ever. And why not? Good stock.
Walter Jr,I'll get it. Nobody's there.
Walter,Beat ya! Hello?
Jesse,"Yo, it’s me."
Walter,"Oh, hi, Carmen. Just Carmen."
Jesse,Come on. Hurry up.
Walter,"So you heard? Good news. She's just so beautiful. Well, Holly. 7 pounds, 3 ounces. Everybody is doing just fine. You junkie imbecile! What are you calling this number for?"
Jesse,"I am trying to tell you, man. Last night, somebody broke in my place, yo. I got robbed."
Walter,What?
Jesse,"Somebody, they got all of our stuff. All of it. You get me, Mr. White? The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny. They knew exactly where to look! I mean, say something, man! Yell at me or something! Come on! God!"
Marie,"Hank, come on! People are starving to death out here!"
Hank,"All right, all right. Had to get a beer. All right, guys. Here we go. We got mild, medium and muy caliente. I got dibs on the breast."
Walter,Los Pollos Hermanos?
Hank,"Yeah, seriously. You gotta try it. This joint gives KFC a run for their money."
Marie,That baby's hungry.
Skyler,"Give me that baby. Aw, sweetie. Come on."
Marie,"Hank, it's only a breast."
Hank,It's my sister-in-law's breast.
Marie,You are so provincial.
Skyler,Remember the day when you were talking to me about child-proofing? What are you thinking? A fence or a cover?
Walter,"Actually, I was thinking more of an alarm system. They've got these new systems out there, ""sonar systems"" that would do anything that falls into it, it sets the alarm off."
Skyler,"That sounds expensive. Well, yeah, but for the baby, I mean..."
Hank,Why don't you let Marie and I get that for you guys?
Marie,Absolutely.
Skyler,"No, please. I'll be back at work soon. We'll take care of it."
Walter,Back at work soon?
Skyler,"Since you're scheduled for surgery, I just thought it might be a good idea to have some money coming in."
Walter,"Skyler, we need to think about what's best for the baby. And I think having her mother around for at least the first few years. Money-wise, we'll manage. I promise you that."
Hank,What? You guys got a printing press in the garage churning out 50s?
Walter Jr,I wish. Mom's even talking about me getting a job.
Skyler,That's right. Everybody pitches in.
Walter,"I'll get her. I'll get her. Good girl. That's a good girl. My little girl, huh? Do you want to see something? Come here. Oh. I know, I know. You want to see what your daddy did for you?"
Walter,Let me show you. Here. Come here. Want to see? That's right. Daddy did that. Daddy did that for you.
Jesse,This place looks exactly the same. Why don't you have computers and shit? It's the 20th century.
Walter,What the hell are you doing here?
Jesse,You took the stash! I heard all those phone messages and I figured it out.
Walter,"You figured it out? Congratulations, Einstein."
Jesse,"You left me to freak out all day long, like I dropped the ball! And you were the one who took it!"
Walter,"Shut up. You lower your voice. ""Like"" you dropped the ball? When have you ever not dropped the ball, Jesse? Blasted out of your mind on whatever the hell that was. What was that? hero1n? Jesus."
Jesse,"I was on my day off, man. What I do on my day off..."
Walter,"Your day off? We were on-call, you junkie. On-call for the biggest deal of our lives. And I just managed to pull it off by the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you. You made me miss the birth of my daughter. Son of a bitch."
Jesse,How much?
Walter,How much what?
Jesse,"How much did you get for the deal?
Walter  $1.2 million."
Jesse,"600,000 each?"
Walter,"480,000. Saul's cut is 20%."
Jesse,"So, where's my money? What?"
Walter,"You are joking, right? If I gave you that money, you would be dead inside of a week."
Jesse,"Look, I'm off the hero1n. I didn't even like it anyway. It made me sick. And the meth. You know, I can take it or leave it. I'm clean, Mr. White. For real."
Walter,Prove it. Pee in that.
Jesse,How gay are you? Seriously.
Walter,"Pee in it. They're selling testing kits at the drug stores. If you are clean, I will give you every last dime. No, huh? Well, I guess, until then, you'll just have to depend on the kindness of strangers to get high. That and your little junkie girlfriend."
Marie,"Not on her tummy, Walt."
Walter,"I'm not putting her on her tummy. I'll put her on her side. Do you want to hold her back? Just in case she decides to do a little spit-up, I'll roll up a nice clean towel like this and put it under."
Marie,Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those. It's hypo-allergenic.
Walter,I think a towel will do. What is it?
Skyler,Your son. He's just unbelievable. Come see what he did.
Walter Jr,I told you it's not ready yet.
Skyler,"Honey, just show it to them."
Walter,"My God, son. That's wonderful."
Marie,"This is beautiful. SaveWalterWhite.com. Well, I, for one, am telling everybody."
Walter,"Wait a minute. You're not asking for money, are you, son?"
Walter Jr,That's the whole idea. Louis helped me set up a PayPal account and everything.
Walter,"But we can't ask for money. I appreciate it. I really do.
Skyler  This was all his idea. He worked so hard on it. Just let him help. You can't ask him to take it down. It'll crush him."
Walter,"Skyler, it's charity."
Skyler,Why do you say that like it's some sort of dirty word?
Walter,"This is insane. I have so much cash on-hand that I actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale. And yet, I can't spend it. I can't tell my family about it. All of whom think that I am right on the edge of bankruptcy. It's insane."
Saul,"Well, I guess that's why gangsters had molls."
Walter,What?
Saul,g*n molls. Haven't you ever seen White Heat?
Walter,"I've seen White Heat, but I don't see how that pertains."
Saul,Maybe you need a moll more than you need a wife who you can't trust with your secrets. What good is money that doesn't spend? If a tree falls in the forest...You get the point. So communicating is out?
Walter,Out.
Saul,"Well, let's see. What else is there? There's always, ""Hey, I found a big bag of money down by the railroad tracks."" Works for me. Uncle Murray. ""Oh, many is the happy memory of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee. We lost track of the old pervert years ago, but what do you know? He kicked it and left me millions."""
Walter,"It cannot be blind luck or some imaginary relative who saves us. I earned that money, me. And now my son created his own website ""SaveWalterWhite. com"" soliciting anonymous donations. Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?"
Saul,"Yeah, look at that. It's got PayPal and everything."
Walter,"Cyber-begging. That's all that is. Just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world. Yeah, there's no deep-seated issues there."
Saul,I'm looking at the answer here. It's staring me in the face. Do I have to spell it out for you?
Walter,"No, I know. You're thinking that I should be funneling my money into my son's website, but absolutely not, no. I am not going to have my family think that some mystery benefactor saved us."
Saul,"Not some mystery benefactor, singular. That would raise too many questions. However stay with me here  Zombies. I got a guy who knows this guy who knows this Rain Man-type. He lives with his mother in her basement in Belarus. So good luck extraditing his fat Russian ass. Wait. He's a hacker-cracker extraordinaire. This guy can hijack random desktops all around the world, turn 'em into zombies that do his bidding. For instance, he can make it so, 20 or 30,000 little donations come in from all over the U.S. and Canada. all paid in-full, nice and neat, untraceable, from the good-hearted people of the world to Mr. Walter H. White, Cancer Saint. I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling just thinking about it."
Jesse,"He's an assh*le, that's what. Always judging me."
Jane,Not too much.
Jesse,"I mean, like, who's he, right? I mean, first off, I taught him. He's always acting like I'm his indentured servant."
Jane,Now the cotton.
Jesse,Needle?
Jane,I don't understand why you need him.
Jesse,Exactly. My point exactly.
Jane,"Flat against your skin so it doesn't wiggle around too much. How much does he owe you, anyway?"
Jesse,480.
Jane,"Well, hell, I'd be mad, too, if somebody owed me 500 bucks."
Jesse,"No. 480,000."
Jane,What? What?
Jesse,Thousand.
Jane,"Not on your back, baby. In case you throw up. On your side. Sleep on your side."
Guy,"She's all like, ""Don't preach to me."" And I'm like, ""Baby, I'm not preaching to you. I'm talking about basic survival, you know? I'm conversing about life and death."" I mean, this here, what we've been doing. Hell, Becky knows."
Jane,"Dad? I overslept. I'm on my way. Dad? Dad, wait. It's not what it looks like. Dad, just wait. Let me talk to you for one second. Come on! Stop it! Don't touch him, Dad!"
Donald,Son of a bitch.
Jane,"Dad, let him go!"
Jesse,"Get away from me, man. Back off. Back off!"
Jane,Everybody just calm down!
Jesse,"What's with you, yo? Huh? 'Cause I'll seriously bust you up."
Donald,You miserable little smackhead. Get the hell out!
Jesse,"Hey, I pay my rent, bitch! I got civil rights!"
Jane,"Jesse, come on. Please, no. Come on."
Jesse,I pay my rent.
Donald,You're going back to rehab. Today. Now.
Jane,"Look, as it so happens, we were just, we were just talking about that and I was gonna tell you, okay? If you would just let me."
Donald,"You have been clean for 18 months, Jane. Why? Why do you do it?"
Jane,"I backslid, okay? Like, what? What, you think I'm proud of this? Like, I do it on purpose?"
Donald,"Lying to me, shacking up and using with this scumbag, this loser!"
Jesse,It takes one to know one!
Jane,"His name is Jesse, and you don't know the first thing about him. We talk about rehab every night. It's his idea."
Donald,"You talk about rehab? Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?"
Jane,"Thank you for not being judgmental 'Cause that's exactly what I need, to be judged all the time!"
Donald,You know what you need? I'll tell you exactly.
Jane,What are you doing? What are you doing?
Donald,I am calling the police.
Jesse,Come on!
Jane,"Dad, don't."
Donald,I have tried ten years of love and understanding. Maybe what it takes is you drying out in a jail cell. I would like to report drug use in a building that I own. No. It's on-going.
Jane,Daddy.
Donald,"It's illegal activity. I'd like to talk to somebody. Would you connect me, please?"
Jane,"Fine, we'll go to rehab."
Donald,I could care less about him going to rehab. I want you in rehab.
Jane,Okay. I'll go first thing tomorrow.
Donald,Not tomorrow. Today.
Jane,"I have to call into work. I have to stock the newspaper. The last time I went to rehab, all my houseplants died because you didn't water them, so. Please? I'll go. Tomorrow."
Donald,I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Tomorrow.
Jesse,You meant all that?
Jane,"I don't know. I just think if we had enough money, nobody could make us do anything."
Walter,Just let it ring.
Skyler,"No, I'm gonna go see who it is."
Walter,"It's okay, Holly."
Skyler,"Good luck with that. But I'm sure he'd be glad to write some...actually, here he is right now. So hold on a second."
Walter,What?
Skyler,It's one of your one of your old students. He wants a letter of recommendation.
Walter,"Honey, I think the baby is getting hungry. This is Walter White. I'm sorry. I'm having a little trouble recalling."
Jane,"It's Jane. You know, of Jesse and Jane. Jesse's ""junkie girlfriend."""
Walter,"Oh, of course. It really has been a long time."
Jane,Jesus. Get somewhere you can talk.
Walter,Sure. Yes. I am looking into that as we speak. How the hell did you get this number? Did Jesse give it to you?
Jane,"All Jesse wants is what's coming to him. No more, no less."
Walter,What are you talking about? He told you about the money.
Jane,He told me everything.
Walter,"So, what is this? Some kind of blackmail or something?"
Jane,"This is me telling you to do right by Jesse and bring him what you owe him. I don't call that blackmail. I call that getting off your ass, and being a decent human being."
Walter,"Well, I call it blackmail. Dialing my number. Talking to my wife. And what's your end of this? How much hero1n does a half a million dollars buy? For your information, I am holding Jesse's money for him, he will receive every last dollar of it. He will. Not you. At a time when I see fit. But I will not contribute to his overdose. Now, you tell him, if he gets clean, ff you both get clean…"
Jane,"You know what? I take that back. This is blackmail. Because what I know about you; High school teacher turned drug dealer with a brother-in-law in the DEA. That'd make one hell of a story. National news, I'll bet. Do right by Jesse tonight or I will burn you to the ground."
Walter,Shit.
Jane,He's a high school teacher. What's he gonna do? Give you a B-minus? Send you outside to clap the erasers?
Jesse,"You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you?"
Jane,We won't have to. He'll pay.
Jesse,What if he doesn't?
Jane,"Jesse, it's your money. You're in the right here. He's in the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay. What is it, really? You don't want your half a million dollars? You wanna renounce your earthly possessions and become a monk?"
Jesse,"It's just, I'm not the kind of dude who rolls. And by extension, neither are you. I mean, he's my partner."
Jane,I'm your partner.
Skyler,"Close your eyes and go to sleep. Hush little baby don’t you cry. Mama’s gonna buy you a mockingbird. If that mockingbird won't sing Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring. If that diamond ring turns brass Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass. So hush, little baby Don't you cry Daddy loves you and so do I. She's finally asleep. What are you doing? Learning about elephants? Honey, we're out of diapers. Would you mind going out?"
Walter,Jesse. Not you. Nice job wearing the pants. How do I know she'll keep quiet?
Jane,I guess you don't.
Jesse,You'll never hear from either of us again.
Walter,"You're not seeing straight, Jesse. You are making a mistake."
Jane,Do you know what this is?
Jesse,It's a whole lot of cheddar.
Jane,"This is freedom. This is saying, ""I can go anywhere I want. I can be anybody."" Who do you want to be? Where do you want to go? South America? Europe? Australia?"
Jesse,Is New Zealand part of Australia?
Jane,New Zealand is New Zealand.
Jesse,"Right on. New Zealand. That's where they made Lord of the Rings. I say we just move there, yo. I mean, you can do your art. Right? Like, you can paint the local castles and shit. And I can be a bush pilot."
Jane,"New Zealand. I can get behind that. But I guess I'm good anywhere as long as it's the two of us. But first we gotta get clean. And not because anybody's telling us to. We do this for us, right?"
Jesse,Absolutely. For us.
Jane,"All this here, we're not gonna just sh**t this up our arms. We're not."
Jesse,"Hell, no. We're better than that. We're way better than that."
Jane,I say we flush what we've got left and we start tonight.
Jesse,We can do that. Definitely.
Bartender,Excuse me. What can I get you?
Walter,"Give me a Fat Tire draft, please. Damn it. Hey, honey. No. I don't know what to tell you. Three stores I've been to so far, and not one of them have it in stock. Do they have to be diapers for newborns? What if we went up a size and just kind of...All right. No, I understand. All right. I'll just keep looking. I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so."
Donald,Well played. They found water on Mars.
Walter,They have indeed.
Donald,"Don't exactly know what to do with that information, but God bless 'em, they found it."
Walter,"Actually, they theoretically can separate the hydrogen from the oxygen and process that into providing fuel for man's space flights. Ostensibly turning Mars into a giant gas station. So, it's a...we live in an amazing time."
Donald,To water on Mars.
Walter,To water on Mars.
Donald,"So, what'd you have? Girl or boy?"
Walter,A little girl.
Donald,That's nice. Congratulations. I have a daughter.
Walter,How old?
Donald,Old enough to know better.
Walter,You have other kids?
Donald,Just the one.
Walter,"I've got a 16-year-old boy. Well, he's almost 16. There's a spread. But he helps out, though. He's even changing some diapers now, so, it's more than I managed to do when I was his age."
Donald,"Kids today grow up faster, I think."
Walter,"Maybe so. So, any advice? Having a daughter. Any advice?"
Donald,"Not really. Just love them. Just I mean, they are who they are."
Walter,"I've got this nephew. This nephew who is I mean, he's an adult. But you can't infantilize them, you can't live their life for them. But still, I mean, there is that frustration. God, that frustration that goes along with, ""Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know what is best for you, so listen."" But of course, they don't. What do you do with someone like that?"
Donald,Family.
Walter,Family.
Donald,"You can't give up on them. Never. I mean, what else is there?"
Walter,"Jesse, it's me! I just want to talk. Jesse? Wake up. Wake up. Oh no."
Jesse,Come on! Please. Come on! God.
Walter,"Hello? Slow down. Slow down. Just take a deep breath. Do it. All right. Now, what happened? Listen to me. Are you listening? Everything is going to be okay. I promise. Now, listen. Calm down. Just sit tight. I know who to call."
Mike,"Saul Goodman sent me. Come on. Inside. Watch the door. Where is she? Any other drugs in the house? Think hard. Your freedom depends on it. What about g*ns? You got any g*ns in the house? Here's your story. You woke up. You found her. That's all you know. Say it. Say it, please. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know. Say it."
Jesse,I woke up. I found her. That's all I know. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Mike,Again.
Jesse,I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Mike,Again. Again.
Jesse,I woke up. I found her. That's all I know. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Mike,"Once you call it in, the people who show up will be with the Office of Medical Investigations. That's primarily who you'll talk to. Police officers may arrive, they may not. Depends on how busy a morning they're having. Typically, OD’s are not a high-priority call. There's nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you just want your lawyer. Then you call Saul Goodman. And do I need to state the obvious? I was not here. You put on a long-sleeved shirt and cover those track marks on your arm. Count down from 20, and then you dial. Hang tough. You're in the home stretch."
Walter,Do you want 2% or skim?
Skyler,Two.
Walter,Junior? Flynn?
Walter Jr,I'll be there in a minute.
Walter,You all right?
Skyler,"Flynn, get your butt in here."
Walter Jr,"My God. Mom, Dad, come here! You got to see this! Seriously."
Walter,What?
Walter Jr,Look right there. Look at that.
Skyler,Are those donations?
Walter Jr,Yes.
Skyler,Actual donations for your dad?
Walter Jr,"Total strangers gave us $490. Virginia, Minnesota, Montana. Look at this one. Vancouver. All the way up in Canada. And it's all real actual money. It's actually right there in the PayPal account. And look what they're saying. ""Hang in there, Walt."" ""Good luck."" ""Hang in there."" Isn't this awesome?"
Walter,That's that is something.
Skyler,"Don't you think a little ""thank you"" is in order?"
Walter,"Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son. Thank you. This is a big, big help."
Walter Jr,Ontario. Damn. $510.
Jane,"Hey. If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you ""Do-Not-Call-List."" However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep."
Donald,"How did I know you wouldn't be answering your phone? I'm on my way. I'm going to be there momentarily. I expect you on the porch, bag packed, ready to go. No excuses."
EMT,Sir? You may not want to be here for this.
Jesse,"I just woke up, and I found her. That's all I know."
EMT,What's her date of birth? Your daughter's date of birth.
Donald,"April 4, 1982."
EMT,And mother's maiden name and place of birth.
Donald,My mother?
EMT,Your daughter's mother.
Donald,Bishop.
EMT,And place of birth?
Donald,Phoenix.
EMT,"Phoenix, Arizona. This is our address. Do you have someone who can drive you?"
Donald,I can drive.
EMT,"Then, if you'd like to meet us there, we can complete the intake and take our samples, and then you can make your arrangements. Now, do you need a card? Will you both be coming?"
Skyler,"I don't believe it. Walt, you have to see this!"
Walter Jr,40 from Terre Haute.
Walter,"It's me. Are you there? I'm just checking in. Our friend says he thinks everything went well. And that's good. So listen. Just call me, all right?"
Skyler,You've got to come in here. We just broke a thousand dollars.
Walter,All right. I'm coming.
Hank,"Some of you already know my brother-in-law. He's a good man. The doctors say this operation has a real chance of helping him. Of course, they're also saying they want to be paid in private islands, so dig deep. Biggest donation gets a six-pack of my very own Schraderbrau. Home-brewed to silky perfection."
Steve,Smallest donation gets two six-packs.
Hank,"Other than Gomie here pees sitting down, here's what we know. Christian Ortega, aka ""Combo."" sh*t dead by an unknown assailant last month. ""Combo?"" I hear you say. ""Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name. Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"" No. He was a dipshit, wannabe banger. Now, no arrests, save for stealing a Baby Jesus from a Knights of Columbus manger back when he was 17. This dude was so low-rep, he never showed up on our radar. So why am I talking about him? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?"
Steve,He was dealing Blue Sky.
Hank,"That's right. How is it that the purest, most professional grade of meth we've ever come across is being slung by the likes of that? But wait. It gets better. Since Baby Jesus thief there slowed a b*llet with his neck, the blue stuff's vanished from town, okay? Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?"
Steve,Because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.
Hank,So says APD. They think they got their man.
Steve,"I know you don't buy it, but maybe it's true."
Hank,"James Edward Kilkelly, yeah. APD thinks this is our mastermind. You believe that, I got a bridge to sell you, okay? He copped to it, didn't he?"
Steve,For an extra pudding cup every night at Los Lunas?
Hank,"Maybe if you give him a pack of cigarettes, he'll tell you what he did with Jimmy Hoffa. I've been thinking. Top-shelf product like this, it doesn't fall off the face of the earth. The way I see it, raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere. It's like Whack-A-Mole. So I've been making phone calls. Local police departments, small-town sheriffs. Haven't had much luck inside the land of enchantment. But outside, I've got reports of the blue stuff making a scene here in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. In fact, everywhere but here. Almost as if somebody wised up, stopped sh1tting where they eat. Now, I say Heisenberg's still out there. I say he's gone regional. Only he's still right here in town."
Skyler,"Come on, 2,800. Come on, big 28. You can do it. Only 30 more dollars."
Walter Jr,$40!
Skyler,Who's going to be next?
Walter,"Your guy found him? Where is he? Okay, listen. I don't care. You have your guy, just shut...Saul, shut up and give me the address."
Mike,"I don't recommend it. APD's been known to sit on this place, keep an eye on the comings and goings."
Walter,Are they here now?
Mike,"Well, I don't see any sign, but that's the point. Police could be the least of it. You could just get mugged or sh*t. How about you go on home, Walter? Let me handle this."
Walter,"Jesse! Look at me. Look at me, son. Wake up."
Jesse,"I ain't got nothing for you, man. It's all gone."
Walter,Wake up. It's me. It's Walt. Let's get out of here.
Jesse,"No, I'm good."
Walter,"Help me out, now. Listen. You are not good right here. You are not good at all. You hear? Put your arms around me. You're going to stand up, and we're going to walk out of here, okay? We're going to take you someplace nice and safe. That's it. Now let's go. Come on. Here we go."
Jesse,I k*lled her.
Walter,What?
Jesse,"I k*lled her. It was me. I k*lled her, man. I k*lled her."
Walter,Look at me. You didn't k*ll anybody.
Jesse,I loved her. I loved her more than anything.
Donald,"I haven't given much thought to the programs, to be honest. I guess they should be, I don't know. Just use your best judgment. There's no yellow dress here. It's all black and gray. When's the last time you saw her ever wearing a yellow dress? What about blue? Blue's better than black, right? Not dark blue. More like not super-bright, either. I mean, blue is blue. No cleavage. Long sleeves. It's nice. It's nice."
Walter,"Big yawn, Holly. I know what you feel like. I'm tired, too. There we go. Would you mind turning that thing down or off? The dinging. Just turn down the volume."
Walter Jr,"Dad, it's money."
Walter,Please do it. The noise is disturbing the baby.
Skyler,"Marie, slow down. I can't...oh, my God. You are kidding me. Sure. Of course. Any day after school. Wait. Let me tell him, and I'll call you right back. Guess what."
Walter Jr,What?
Skyler,You are going to be in the newspaper.
Walter Jr,No way.
Skyler,"One of Aunt Marie's patients works at the Journal. When she told him about the website and the donations, he went to his editor, and they're doing a story about you."
Walter Jr,For real?
Skyler,They're coming to interview you with a photo and everything.
Walter Jr,Awesome. It'll mean more hits.
Skyler,And more contributions.
Hank,"East of Scottsdale? Let me guess. Not talking. Nope. Not a one. Someone somewhere is running one tight ship. All right, Chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot. You, too."
Merkert,"Agent Schrader, can you spare a moment?"
Hank,"Yes, sir. Absolutely."
Merkert,"Gentlemen, this is supervising agent Hank Schrader. Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel."
Hank,Nice to meet you.
Andrew,Nice to meet you.
Merkert,Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.
Paul,It's a pleasure.
Hank,Good to meet you.
Merkert,And Gustavo Fring of Los Pollos Hermanos.
Gustavo,"Please, just Gus."
Hank,"Got to tell you, you guys make some k*ller chicken."
Gustavo,Thank you very much.
Merkert,"They are underwriting this year's fun run, and I thought I would give them a tour."
Hank,Absolutely. Get to see what you're supporting.
Merkert,We thank you gentlemen. Can you tell us a little about your work here?
Hank,"The Albuquerque office covers everything from drug-related money laundering to interdiction of illicit controlled substances crossing the border. Now, the group that I supervise focuses on methamphetamine, which is a growing problem in the country, unfortunately."
Gustavo,Terrible.
Merkert,It is indeed.
Hank,"Now, we've had some successes locally, but overall the supply seems to be growing. But I got to tell you, community outreach, like this fun run, one of the most powerful w*apons we have. Anything we can do."
Merkert,Gentlemen.
Gustavo,Is this one of your agents?
Hank,No. That's my brother-in-law. He's got a health issue.
Gustavo,I'm very sorry. What sort of health issue?
Hank,Lung cancer.
Gustavo,That's a rough one.
Hank,You don't have to do that.
Gustavo,Please. I'm happy to do it.
Hank,Thank you very much.
Gustavo,You're welcome.
Walter,"Just so you know, I won't be back for a while. I'm going to have my surgery on Friday. I'm hopeful it'll go well. But if not, Saul will take care of things. He's got your money. He's keeping it for you. Lingering on things doesn't help, believe me. Just try and focus on getting better, okay?"
Jesse,I deserve this.
Walter,What?
Jesse,What you said in the desert. I get it what you meant. I deserve whatever happens.
Marie,There he is! We're doing a feature on Walter Junior. We called you about 50 times.
Walter,I thought we were just talking about a newspaper story.
Marie,"I know. But I thought, if it's good enough for the Journal, then why not TV? So I went for it."
Reporter,This is him?
Marie,This is Dad.
Reporter,"Great. Let's get everyone on the couch. I'm thinking Walt Junior in the middle, Mom and Dad on either side. Mom and Dad? How much money have you raised so far?"
Walter Jr,"$6,360. But there's more coming in all the time."
Reporter,That's amazing.
Skyler,We don't even know what to say. It's been incredible.
Reporter,"Judging from the things you and other folks have written about him, your dad must be quite a guy."
Walter Jr,He is. He's the best.
Reporter,"You don't want to lose him, do you, Walter?"
Walter Jr,None of us do. We love him.
Reporter,"He's a good man, isn't he?"
Walter Jr,"Absolutely. Ask anyone. Anybody. He's a great father, a great teacher. He knows, like, everything there is to know about chemistry. He's patient with you, and he's always there for you. He's just decent, and he always does the right thing, that's how he teaches me to be."
Reporter,Would you say he's your hero?
Walter Jr,"Yes, ma'am. Totally. My dad is my hero."
Walter Jr,Does that put him to sleep?
Nurse,This one just relaxes him a little. We're almost ready. We'll be taking you in in just a minute.
Walter,Here we are.
Walter Jr,Relaxed yet?
Walter,"As a matter of fact I don't know what this stuff is, but it's pretty great."
Skyler,"Yeah, it looks like it. We'll be here when you wake up."
Walter,I'll be looking for you.
Skyler,They'll probably want me to take your glasses.
Walter,"Yeah, you better."
Skyler,Where's your phone?
Walter,Huh?
Skyler,Your cellphone. Did you bring it?
Walter,Which one?
Walter Jr,"I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom."
Skyler,Okay.
Dr. Delcavoli,First things first. How old is the baby now? And when do I finally get to meet her?
Skyler,"I was actually thinking of bringing her today, but."
Walter,"She's seven weeks tomorrow. Seven, right?"
Skyler,"I have a picture here, somewhere."
Dr. Delcavoli,"She's beautiful. Always a relief to say that and actually mean it. How's your pain level, Walter?"
Walter,"Very low, basically."
Dr. Delcavoli,Shortness of breath?
Walter,"A bit, but much better."
Dr. Delcavoli,"Good. Your margins look good. Obviously, I can't foresee the future, but even conservatively speaking, I can say that you bought yourself some real time here. There's no reason not to be optimistic."
Walter,That's great.
Skyler,"That is great. So, when could he get back to his normal routine?"
Dr. Delcavoli,He can ease into it now. And can he go back to work or I'd give it a few more weeks. Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting and continue to get plenty of rest.
Skyler,"But he can be on his own? Just more, independent."
Dr. Delcavoli,Use your best judgment.
Walter,"That's good news for you, honey? One less baby in the house."
Coworker,Donald. Welcome back.
Donald,Thanks. It's good to be back.
Coworker,"Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear. Terrible thing. Just, but you know, we've all been thinking about you, and...you've been doing okay?"
Donald,"I'm doing okay. After a certain point, time off doesn't help, so I figured I'd rather be here, focus on work."
Coworker,Sure. Absolutely. See you inside.
Donald,"Truth Or Consequences altimeter, Pima 311, contact Albuquerque Center 134. 6. Juliet 5 Bravo, ident say altitude. Juliet 5 Bravo, roger. Cleared direct to Winslow."
Walter,"I think I may just keep this. What do you think? Doesn't look so bad, right? What are you doing?"
Skyler,I'm going to Hank and Marie's for the weekend.
Walter,Since when?
Skyler,I'm taking the baby with me. Marie will pick up Walter Junior from school. You'll have the house to yourself for two days. I want you to pack your things and leave.
Walter,Why would I do that?
Skyler,"Hank has offered to help, since you shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting. I want you gone by Monday morning. I want you gone."
Walter,Can you at least tell me why?
Skyler,"Because you're a liar, Walt. Two cell phones, after all."
Walter,What?
Skyler,"Right before your surgery, I asked if you had packed your cell phone, and you said, ""Which one?"""
Walter,When? I was medicated. I could have said the world was flat.
Skyler,You know what I think? I think you accidentally told the truth.
Walter,"Honey, we have been over this. Asked and answered, right?"
Skyler,"Then it got me thinking again about all the strange behavior, not the least of which was the disappearance. Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals, checking the morgue. Your fugue state. I had to believe that, didn't I? I had to find a way. I mean who would lie about such a thing?"
Walter,You tell me. You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about. What? I'm having an affair. Is that what you think?
Skyler,Yes. For the last few weeks.
Walter,With whom? Who am I having an affair with?
Skyler,My guess was Gretchen Schwartz. Something was going on between you. I just knew.
Walter,"Jesus. Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes. I am not having an affair with Gretchen."
Skyler,"I know. I know you're not. Because I asked her. It really took me forever to get in touch with her. She was ducking my calls for weeks. So I finally left a message ""What exactly is going on between you and my husband?"" I thought that would get her attention, and it did. So she called me back, and she finally told me. The money for your treatment, Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you. But that didn't make sense because I checked with Delcavoli at the hospital, and not including your surgery, we're nearly paid up. Over $100,000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then I called your mother. Thanks for that, too. But I thought, maybe she has some money that I don't know about. Maybe she contributed. It's possible. It turns out that not only is the money not from your mother, she didn't even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her. I dropped you at the airport. I picked you up. You were gone for four days, and yet she swears that you were never there. Lies on top of lies on top of lies. Could you just once do me the courtesy of not denying it?"
Walter,"Don't do this, please. Please don't go. Skyler! If I tell you the truth, will you stay? Stay, and I will tell you everything."

Reporter,"We interrupt scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news. Good afternoon. In the last several minutes KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft, possibly two aircraft on Albuquerque's east side. As of yet details are scarce but callers describe witnessing an expl*si*n overhead followed by falling debris. Visible now"
Reporter,"Crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on site as early as this evening. But officials warn that with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation Officials are now saying that the Boeing 737 was being re-routed, or vectored, through the airspace which is standard procedure according to a spokesman for the FAA."
Reporter,"The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of St. George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas."
Reporter,"It sounded like hail, like heavy hailstones. It was just bump-bump-bump, all over the neighborhood…"
Reporter,Indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
Reporter,One hundred and sixty-seven. This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
Reporter,That the collision which brought down Flight 515 was caused by improper air traffic control. We have the bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City as the FAA confirmed it was indeed a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake which brought about the crash.
Reporter,"Is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque. Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence which was due to, quote, ""a personal loss"". While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a…"
Reporter,"Drug overdose a month before. His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26 apparently had a long history of substance abuse. Friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard. Coming as it did little more than a month before, many are questioning the timing of his return to work and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father…"
Lawyer,"I usually open with ""So sorry you're here"". Where would you like to begin?"
Skyler,"I really just need this quick and easy, you know? As quick as something like this can be. So…"
Lawyer,Okay. Is that mutual? Does your husband go along with that? Does he know?
Skyler,"Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so."
Lawyer,Has he moved out?
Skyler,"We're in the process of moving him out. Yeah. Today, hopefully. And in the meantime, my son, my daughter and I are staying with my sister."
Lawyer,So you've moved out?
Skyler,"Well, yes, just temporarily. Only so he could get his things. And that was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash and…"
Lawyer,"Oh, God, you weren't one of the…?"
Skyler,"Right, yeah. Right beneath the flight path. And we had debris land in our yard, and all over our neighborhood, so."
Lawyer,Terrible.
Skyler,"Yeah. Apparently, even you know, parts of bodies. So I certainly couldn't bring myself to…"
Lawyer,So awful.
Skyler,"I know. Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back. But it's time. And I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall."
Lawyer,"Well, you definitely wanna maintain residency in your actual home. It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody. Two children, you said?"
Skyler,"Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son in high school, Walter Jr. They need to stay with me."
Lawyer,Okay. How long have you been married?
Skyler,Sixteen years.
Lawyer,"And it's not an apartment, it's a house that you live in? Do you own outright, do you have a mortgage?"
Skyler,"Yes, there's definitely a mortgage. We have maybe 15 years on it."
Lawyer,What about other debts or assets? Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation? Is your husband employed?
Skyler,"Here's the thing. I'm really not looking for any sort of loopholes or I don't know, just…"
Lawyer,"No, no loopholes. I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own. To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned. You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another."
Hank,"Walt? Hey, buddy? Hey, Walt? Hey. There you are. Listen, I…You know, well, it's time."
Hank,"The shittiest week since 9l11, okay? Bar none. This is it. Hands down, we're living it. I speak with authority because we had some shitty weeks the past few months. But this here? I mean call freaking Guinness Book of World Records, call freaking…am I talking too much? I am, right? I am, I know. But this situation between you and you know, I don't know. I'm not asking, by the way. It's none of my business. I do not wanna get in the middle of you two. I'm just saying, listen, okay? You beat a little tactical retreat you regroup, and then  You know, absence makes the…yeah. I'm pulling for you, man. I'm pulling for you. No heavy lifting."
Walt,I got it.
Hank,"No, it's okay. I got it. Jesus. What do you got in there, cinder blocks?"
Walt,Half a million in cash.
Hank,"That's the spirit. I got it, I got it."
Counselor,"Who's here for self-improvement? Come on, give me a show of hands. Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are? All right. See, that's your first mistake. You should be here to learn self-acceptance."
Skyler,"Hey, honey, you want another waffle? I still got the iron out. I could cut up some bananas."
Answering Machine,"Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn and Holly. Please leave us a message."
Walt,"Hey. Hello, everybody. Good morning. I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information. You certainly can always reach me on my cell I've always got that on me, but in terms of a mailing address I'm here at the Beachcomber and you know what, it's actually very nice, very pleasant. Not as high-end as the Oakwood, but not as corporate."
Skyler,"Oh, hey, would you please just?"
Walter Jr,"Hey, Dad, it's me. No, I'm not okay. I don't know what's going on. Nobody's telling me jackshit around here."
Skyler,"Hey, Flynn."
Walter Jr,Whatever. I don't even care anymore. Can you just give me a ride to school?
Skyler,I'll take you to school.
Walter Jr,"Yeah. No, I'm ready now."
Skyler,"Flynn, I'm taking you to school."
Walter Jr,"All right, I'm here. See you soon."
Carmen,"Okay. May I have your attention, please? As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy. One that none of us will ever forget. Which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk."
Barry,"I just find it, you know, really, really hard to concentrate. Because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived. It just really gets inside your brain and in college, they have this thing where if your roommate kills himself like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever it's basically an a*t*matic A for you. And I just think that that kind of compassion is something to…"
Carmen,"Okay. Thank you, Barry. Who wants to go next? No judgments, guys. Just feelings. You can say anything and everything that's on your mind. Anyone? There you go, honey."
Student,I just keep asking myself…
Carmen,"Honey, could you please stand up? Thank you."
Student,"I just keep asking myself, ""Why did this happen?"" I mean, if there's a God and all why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?"
Carmen,"Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?"
Student,"Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much. Does anyone else have that? I just keep hearing that sound. That boom. It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop."
Carmen,"Thank you, sweetheart. Is there anyone else? Over here."
Other Student,"My neighbor, he heard the crash and he ran outside, and he found, like, this seat. Like an airline seat. Like what you have on an airliner? Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard right next to his Sea-Doos, because, like, he has Sea-Doos. But there was still a pair of legs buckled into them. Human legs."
Walt,Jesus H. Christ.
Carmen,You okay?
Walt,"Yeah, sorry. I'm, I was just moved."
Carmen,"Maybe we should hear from the faculty. Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students. Mr. White, would you like to say something? And by the way, welcome back. It's so good to have you back."
Walt,"I guess what I would…sorry, sorry. I guess what I would wanna say is to look on the bright side. First of all, nobody on the ground was k*lled. And that I mean, an incident like this, over a populated urban center? That right there, that's just gotta be some minor miracle. So. Plus, neither plane was full. You know, the 737 was, what, maybe two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes? Or maybe even three-quarters full? Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th-worst air disaster. Actually, tied for 50th. There are, in truth 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse. Tenerife. Has anybody? Anybody hear of Tenerife? No? In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife. Does anybody know how big a 747 is? I mean, it's way bigger than a 737, and we're talking about two of them. Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife. But do any of you even remember it at all? Any of you? I doubt it. You know why? It's because people move on. They just move on. And we will too. We will move on, and we will get past this. Because that is what human beings do, we survive, and…we survive and we overcome. Yeah. We survive. We survive and…Okay? Thank you. Good."
Walt,"Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?"
Walter Jr,Fine. I guess.
Walt,"You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?"
Walter Jr,Why don't you just come inside? It's your house.
Walt,"No, I…"
Marie,"He's gone. Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?"
Walter Jr,How's what?
Marie,Tricks. It's an expression. How are you?
Walter Jr,Why you gotta treat him like this? Why you gotta be like this? Why can't you just talk even?
Marie,"Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay? Out of the mouths of babes, huh? You know, try not to hold it against him. You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity. You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder. He's probably wondering, ""What is it that could have gone so wrong that my mother would leave?"""
Skyler,Marie. Marie.
Marie,"I can't help you get through this you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did?"
Skyler,"Well, you know what, I don't remember asking you, all right? So if you wanna be supportive, you could be supportive without prying. That would be really great."
Marie,"""Prying."""
Skyler,And so helpful.
Marie,"Well, prying's a strong word."
Counselor,"It's that voice inside your head. It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, You know what I'm talking about. That voice that tells you you're not good enough. Not good enough for what? Not good enough to be what? President of the United States? Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good. But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness? Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are? I say yes. But it doesn't matter what I say. It's your voice, which means you're the one that hears it. Which means you're the only one that can fight it, right? Jesse, we never hear from you. What's going on? You can tell me I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind. Just come on. Let us in on it."
Jesse,"So, like, what makes you the expert?"
Counselor,I don't think I ever said I was that.
Jesse,"Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right? Telling us ""thus"" and ""so, be happy,"" ""forgive yourself,"" blah, blah, blah. Have you ever really hurt anybody? I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever but did you ever really hurt someone?"
Counselor,"I k*lled my daughter. It was July 18th, which is my birthday. July 18th, 1992. I was high on coca1ne and I was drunk. coca1ne wasn't an issue. I had bought myself two grams as a birthday present. I had plenty left. But I was out of vodka. And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p. m. , and right then it was like 4 42. So I'm arguing with my wife. ""Come on. Go to the ABC for me, it's my birthday. Come on. They're not gonna sell it to me"". And she's saying ""No, no."" So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck. My 6-year-old daughter is playing at the end of the driveway. So…"
Jesse,How do you not hate yourself?
Counselor,"I did hate myself for a long time. But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high. It just made it that much worse. Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing. It just stands in the way."
Jesse,Stands in the way of what?
Counselor,True change.
Walt,Skyler.
Skyler,Is this a good time to talk?
Walt,Yeah. Come in. Please. Skyler. Do you wanna start?
Skyler,Okay.
Walt,Why are you doing this? Why are you even thinking this way? Is it to punish me?
Skyler,"I am not punishing you, Walt."
Walt,"This is punitive, is what this is. We are happily married. I am happily married. I am happy. We're just, I love you, Skyler. And I would do anything for you. Would you even consider? I mean, Jesus! You come in here and you wave these papers in my face when there's a whole other, entire side to this thing. There's your side and there's my side, and you haven't heard my side yet. You haven't heard any of it at all."
Skyler,You're a drug dealer.
Walt,No. What? How? What?
Skyler,"Yeah. How else could you possibly make that kind of money? Marijuana. That Pinkman kid. No? Oh, my God, Walt. coca1ne?"
Walt,"It's methamphetamine. But I'm a manufacturer, I'm not a dealer per se. It doesn't mean, no, Skyler! Listen to me. Skyler, listen."
Skyler,"No, no!"
Walt,"There are a lot of angles to this, okay? It's complicated, all right? So please, please, let's just sit back down and talk it through."
Skyler,"I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt. I won't tell Hank and I won't tell your children or anybody else. Nobody will hear it from me. But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives."
Walt,"No, Skyler."
Skyler,I mean it. Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.
Counselor,"Bye, Jesse."
Jesse,Your windshield's broken.
Walt,Yeah.
Walt,"Little friction in the marriage right now. Strictly temporary. We're just, we're just taking a little break. That's you, over there. Listen, money. Saul has got it for you, so as soon as you're feeling better…"
Jesse,I'm better.
Walt,"You're better? Really? What, the rehab? It helped?"
Jesse,Yeah. I'm done using.
Walt,"That's excellent. That's very good, Jesse. Boy, very good. You know, in spite of how bad things got it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us. I mean, you know, just to get our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow."
Jesse,You've been following this airplane crash?
Walt,Yeah.
Jesse,You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together because he was so torn up?
Walt,"Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right? You are not responsible for this. Not in any way, shape or form, all right? Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are and there are many factors at play there."
Jesse,Yeah?
Walt,"For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working. That's public record. You can look that up. And the whole system is run on 1960s technology. No. No, really, I blame the government."
Jesse,"You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White."
Walt,What exactly does that mean?
Jesse,I learned it in rehab. It's all about accepting who you really are. I accept who I am.
Walt,And who are you?
Jesse,I'm the bad guy.
Gus,Here's some napkins for you. Enjoy. Is the food to your satisfaction?
Walt,Very much.
Gus,It's good to see you again. May I?
Walt,Please.
Gus,I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
Walt,"I actually am not here to, I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally. I'm done. It has nothing to do with you personally. I find you extraordinarily professional and I appreciate the way you do business. I'm just making a change in my life, is what it is. And I'm at something of a crossroads and it's brought me to a realization. I am not a criminal. No offence to any people who are but this is not me."
Gus,"I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding."
Walt,"It won't change my mind, I'm sorry."
Gus,"Three million dollars for three months of your time. Three months, then out."
Walt,Three million?
Gus,"May I take this as a ""yes""?"
Walt,I have money. I have more money than I know how to spend. What I don't have is my family. The answer is still no.
Gus,Enjoy your meal.
Walt,Thank you.
Olive Oil,"That's it! Did you feel it? Texas! I've made this trip three times and every time there's three big bumps and that's how you know! We are officially in Texas! This time I got a job waiting for me. I got a cousin who's got a body shop. Yo, that's for me, homes! They call me ""Olive Oil"" because I paint them slick. I do pearlescent, color-shift, you name it. I painted cars for some of the biggest gangsters in Michoacan. Wow, those are beautiful boots! Not much good for working, but, hey, what's on the toes there? Little silver…"
Driver,What the hell's going on in there?
Walt,"Good morning, officer."
Cop,Can you turn the music down?
Walt,"Oh, okay."
Cop,Down means off. You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Walt,"Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding. I've been using the cruise control, so I don't…"
Cop,"No, sir, your windshield. License and registration, please."
Walt,Right. This was from Wayfarer 515. My house was in the debris field.
Cop,Okay.
Walt,"And that's what shattered my windshield, some piece of wreckage from the plane."
Cop,I understand.
Walt,"You know of flight 515, the plane crash? You're wearing the ribbon."
Cop,"Yes, sir. I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515. I was one of the first responders on the scene."
Walt,Then what are you doing?
Cop,"Citing you, sir."
Walt,"What? What, you don't believe me?"
Cop,"Regardless of how that windshield was damaged this car is unsafe to drive in this condition. Stay in the car, please."
Walt,Wait. Wait just a minute. Just one minute.
Cop,I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
Walt,I can get out of my own car.
Cop,"Sir, listen."
Walt,"No, you listen to me. It's time for you to listen to me."
Cop,"Take a deep breath, calm down."
Walt,"This is America, okay?"
Cop,Get back in that car.
Walt,I have rights. You understand that? At least have the common decency to hear me out.
Cop,Step back now.
Walt,Did you even hear what I said?
Cop,"Sir, calm down."
Walt,You're giving me a ticket? I told you that my house was in the debris field. Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
Cop,"Sir, calm down."
Walt,Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
Cop,I need you to step back now.
Walt,There were body parts in my yard! Are you kidding me?!
Cop,"Sir, last warning. You got two seconds to stand down."
Walt,Or?
Cop,I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
Walt,Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect. Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Hank,"Lastly a little something from down El Paso way. Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border. Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo. Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years. But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them. Hit them hard. We're talking a driver and nine illegals. No sign of the shooters."
Steve,"So this truck was carrying more than just people. What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?"
Hank,"No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics."
Steve,Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
Hank,"They didn't. I pulled it. You ask me, this is high-end cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe. Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ? They sending a message? Clearing a path? Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper? Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't. Anyway, keep your eyes open. All right, that's it."
Steve,Slow news day. Add one more to the countdown.
Hank,"Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?"
Steve,We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours. Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
Hank,"It's still out there, Gomey. Don't worry. Local P. D. I gotta take this. Gomey, go beat your pinata. Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here. Catch some bad guys. Schrader. Hey, what's up, Walt? What?"
Mr,Pinkman  Jesse?
Jesse,"Hey, Dad. Fixing up the house, huh?"
Mr,"Pinkman  Doing a little work, yeah."
Jesse,"Well, I'll bounce. It's cool."
Mr,Pinkman  You doing okay?
Jesse,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign. So you're selling the place."
Mr,Pinkman  In this market. Can you believe it?
Jesse,I see you moved the garage. That's bold.
Mr,"Pinkman  Your mother's idea. It's quite an operation. We did all new stucco, all new master suite sandblasted, fumigated the basement."
Jesse,"Right on. Yeah. You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value. I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine. So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?"
Mr,"Pinkman  All redone. New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances. All top-of-the line."
Jesse,"Damn. That's great, Dad. Think I can get a tour?"
Mr,"Pinkman  These guys are trying to finish up. Maybe we'd better stay out of their way. There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look."
Jesse,Cool.
Mr,Pinkman  You're looking healthy. I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.
Jesse,"Thanks. You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something."
Mr,Pinkman  Yeah. Sometime.
Jesse,"Okay. Later, Dad."
Hank,"You know, look, he's a high-school teacher. He's never been in trouble a day in his life. He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor b*st*rd out of his own house. I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy. Hey, Walt. Remember Officer Cavanaugh?"
Walt,"Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper. There's no excuse for my behavior. It was disrespectful."
Hank,"Yeah. Thanks, man."
Walt,She's divorcing me.
Hank,"I don't know what to tell you, buddy. It is what it is."
Walt,She doesn't want me to see the kids.
Hank,She said that?
Walt,Yeah.
Saul,"You don't write, you don't call."
Walt,God. It's a disaster.
Saul,It is not a disaster.
Walt,"Oh, okay. It's not a disaster, all right?"
Saul,"She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul. You wanna know why? One word  Blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed. You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil. My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in. And the house? Gone. Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that. No. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing and she knows it."
Walt,"Her going to the police is not the point, Saul. She's out of my life. Do you understand? I've lost my family. Everything that I care about."
Saul,"Hey, buddy. It's bad. It's a calamity."
Walt,"Oh, my God."
Saul,"But we live to fight another day. And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea. You've been out of circulation for a while. You'll be just amazed at what's out there. Thailand, the Czech Republic. I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here. In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything. So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best? First step  Talk to our friend and get cooking."
Walt,I can't be the bad guy.
Saul,What?
Walt,I can't be the bad guy.
Saul,"Okay. You know, we'll revisit. Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet."
Kaylee,"Pop-pop! Pop-pop, the ice cream man!"
Mike,Don't tell your mom.
Kaylee,Okay.
Mike,Yeah.
Saul,"It's me. We may have a wife problem. Look, I need eyes on it."
Mike,You got an address?
Skyler,"Hey. Dinner's gonna be late. Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Scene  Dinner Table"
Hank,"Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?"
Marie,What? I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Hank,"Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're eating raw fish. That's all I'm saying. Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming. Right, buddy?"
Skyler,"Yeah. You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to…"
Walter Jr,"My name's Walter Jr. Like, what, you can't even say his name?"
Skyler,If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Walter Jr,"Dad didn't even show up till fourth period. And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something. But you, you don't even care! And now he won't even drive me home. He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to."
Skyler,"Honey, I…"
Walter Jr,"What? I don't know what your problem is. You may not love him anymore, but I do. I mean, why you gotta be? Why you gotta be such a bitch?!"
Hank,"Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Oh, God. You can't talk to your mom like that."
Skyler,"Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's all right."
Hank,"Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this. Sky, I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids? I mean…"
Skyler,"You're right, Hank. It's none of your business."
Marie,"Oh, my God. After all of that? Please, tell me that you are still not curious."
Hank,There's nothing to be curious about.
Marie,"Oh, please."
Hank,"The day I heard the words ""second cell phone"" I knew. Believe me. Seen it a hundred times."
Marie,"Okay. All right. So, what? Stop dancing around it. What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times? Please, please enlighten me."
Hank,"Look, a guy like Walt? Nice guy, decent, smart. But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay? He gets cancer. Time's running out. Mid-life crisis. He acts up. He steps out. And the wife, she catches him. I mean, it's a story as old as time. Look, do the math, Marie. It only comes out one way. Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself."
Marie,"I don't know. I think if he cheated on her, she would have told me by now. It just feels like something more."
Saul,"Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage. Need you ask? How much is this gonna run me? Jesus, I'm in the wrong business. Yeah, I'll call you. Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living. How you feeling?"
Jesse,I'm good.
Saul,"Of course you are. The world's your oyster. Am I right? Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash. Hey, I'm jealous. Hand to God, I'm jealous. Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately? Your former partner. This guy, he works like a b*st*rd, right? Builds a business single-handed. Finally the big money shows up and what does he do? He walks out. Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper. It's like Michelangelo won't paint. Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you? Help him pull his head out of his ass? All right, all right, scratch that. Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you. All due respect."
Jesse,You want a job?
Saul,A job? Who's got a job for me?
Jesse,I do.
Skyler,There you go.
Ted,"Hey. Hey. Thought I'd well visit, if you don't mind."
Skyler,"Of course not. You don't need the room, do you?"
Ted,"No, no, no. I just needed some more space to spread out. Wanted to say hello to little Holly. Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah. She's a beauty. Look at her."
Skyler,"Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in."
Ted,I just wish we had you back full-time. You do brighten up the place.
Skyler,"Listen, believe me, this is I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies. I'm sorry, I just can't."
Ted,Is that right?
Skyler,"If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring."
Ted,Glaring. Okay. That does sound bad. Show me what's bothering you.
Skyler,Keller. Again.
Ted,"Oh, God, I'm sorry. I know how you feel about this."
Skyler,"Revenue with no backup. Here, here and here. I don't even know what to say."
Ted,"Yeah. Yeah, well, okay. This is fixable, right? How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter? Would you sign it then?"
Skyler,I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Ted,"Fair enough. I'll take care of it. Thank you for the heads-up. You won't have to deal with this again, I swear."
Skyler,What if your kids found out?
Ted,If my kids found out?
Skyler,This. What you're doing. Someday they're gonna be old enough. How would you explain it to them?
Ted,"Well, put me on the spot, why don't you? I guess maybe I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them. You know, trying to provide. And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand You know what? Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler. I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so I'd better get back to it."
Skyler,"Oh, God. Hi, Walt. Listen, I can't talk I'm at work right now. What?"
Walt,"Louis dropped him off. He was here when I got home. No, no, no, of course. No, he's not staying. He understands that. I'll bring him anywhere you want."
Walter Jr,Dad.
Walt,"Well, yeah. It is rush hour. I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now. But wouldn't it be easier if we? Right, okay, good. So we'll meet you at the house. Okay, bye."
Walter Jr,Why are you doing this? She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Walt,"Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons."
Walter Jr,What reasons?
Walt,"They're well, they're just a little difficult to delineate. But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always. But she…yeah. This is just how it has to be for now, okay? Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?"
Walter Jr,"But it's where you belong. Dad, it's your house. Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong. Everybody is on your side."
Walt,"Well, it's not about taking sides, though."
Walter Jr,How can you let her treat you like this?
Walt,Come on.
Walter Jr,How can you just take it?
Walt,"Now just listen to me, okay? No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay? We both love you very, very much, okay? You and your sister will come first always. Come on. Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay? Both of us. Let's just buck up. And I'll take you home. Let me first just hit the old bathroom here."
Saul,Hello. Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Pinkman,"You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?"
Saul,Better call Saul! I get it all the time.
Lawyer,We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
Saul,"I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right? Well, folks, today's your lucky day. I represent a client who shall remain nameless. However, for our purposes you might just as well visualise a large bag of money. This individual wants to buy your house today for cash."
Mrs. Pinkman,Cash?
Saul,"Cash. I know, in this economy. The money is already burning a hole in my client's account. You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown him all the pertinent financials."
Lawyer,It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Saul,"Fair enough. We get a few papers signed and notarised we can take care of this right now. In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon. There's just one little hair in the soup. The price."
Lawyer,We feel 875 is very fair.
Mr,Pinkman  But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
Saul,"Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?"
Lawyer,"Four hundred thousand? What is that, a joke?"
Saul,"No, that's my offer."
Mrs. Pinkman,That's less than half-price.
Mr,Pinkman  We put that much into the renovations alone.
Lawyer,Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
Saul,Four hundred thousand. That's my final offer.
Mr,Pinkman  Waste of time.
Mrs. Pinkman,Ridiculous.
Lawyer,How could you possibly imagine we'd entertain this?
Mr,"Pinkman  Come on, hon."
Saul,"I don't know. I thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab. That used to be in the basement. I looked over your signed disclosure statements and I don't see any mention of a meth lab. Nope. Oh, you got your termite inspection. That's good. But no meth lab. Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony. I, myself, am more open-minded. But it is tricky. Now, don't get me wrong. I applaud your cojones. I mean, good try at sneaking a meth-contaminated property past a buyer. I mean, could've been a good deal for you. Too bad. Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely. Or I could start some criminal proceedings. But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we? How about it, counselor? Do you concur?"
Walt,"There you go, son. Come on. It's not Devil's Island. Okay. Oh, hey."
Skyler,Hello.
Walt,Brought pizza.
Skyler,"Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner."
Walt,"Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge. It's even better the next day."
Skyler,"Hi, honey."
Walt,"Skyler. I mean, what kind of example do we want to set here, right? I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together? Just hash things out like adults?"
Skyler,We have discussed everything we need to discuss. I thought I made myself very clear.
Walt,I got dipping sticks.
Answering Machine,"You've reached Walt's temporary number. Please, leave a message."
Skyler,"When I went out this morning to get the newspaper I saw a pizza on our roof. Would you know anything about that? Listen to me, Walt. You need to control yourself. Calm down, accept the situation and keep your distance. If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order."
Walt,Skyler. Skyler. Got your restraining order right here! Restrain this!
Mr,"Pinkman  Breaking even is not so bad. In this economy, a lot of people would k*ll to break even."
Mrs. Pinkman,Poor Jake. He had his heart set on going to Space Camp.
Mr,"Pinkman  Oh, no. Oh, God. This is all we need."
Jesse,"Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?"
Mr,"Pinkman  Jesse, it's really not a good time. Come on."
Mrs. Pinkman,"Jesse, the house has been sold. The new owners are expected at any moment. Where do you think you're going?"
Jesse,Inside. I bought the place.
Mike,It's me. There's something he should know about.
Tortuga,More. Another.
Bartender,"Careful, senor. Hot day like today too much oil in the machine can cause it to blow a gasket."
Tortuga,"There are two kinds of men in this world. Those who drink and those who pour. Shut up and fill my glass. Hey, you two. Yes, you. I used to be just like you. Worked dirt for the man till my hands bled. But no more. Because I learned that a man can never drink his fill by waiting in line for the tap."
Bolsa,Listen to him. He can teach you something!
Tortuga,"Hey, how you doing, boss?"
Bolsa,"Good to see you, my friend. You know, I never pegged you for such a deep thinker."
Tortuga,I keep thinking I should write a book.
Bolsa,"Maybe, maybe"
Tortuga,"So, what brings you to this burro's assh*le of a town?"
Bolsa,"I knew I would find you here. Don't you have something to deliver? Cutting it close, aren't you?"
Tortuga,"Lots of time. Tortuga may be slow out of the gate, but he always…"
Bolsa,"Finishes first. Yes, I know. Just like your namesake. I like the way you talk, Tortuga."
Tortuga,Yeah?
Bolsa,"You've got such a way with words. They flow like a waterfall. I like that about you. I'm so stupid. I missed your birthday. No, I feel terrible. So bad I came all the way here to this burro's assh*le to give you your present."
Tortuga,"Present? Come on, boss. No need to go through the trouble."
Bolsa,"Forget it, I wanted to. I have it for you in the back."
Tortuga,Back there?
Bolsa,Yes. Come. Follow me.
Tortuga,It's perfect!
Bolsa,Do you really like it?
Tortuga,"I love it! What a great pet it will make. Thank you, boss!"
Bolsa,"Excellent. Let me sign it for you. Let me sign it ""For the big talker."""
Mike,"He's still breathing. Well, by the looks of him, he has no idea how close he came. I'm assuming Saul Goodman doesn't need to know. Mum's the word."
Skyler,"Hang on, baby."
Walt,Hello.
Skyler,Walt? Are you in the house?
Walt,"Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me."
Skyler,What? What the hell are you doing in there?
Walt,I'm back.
Skyler,"No, no, you're not back, Walt. You're not back. Get out of there."
Walt,"Well, it's my house too, Skyler. No I'm staying. End of story."
Skyler,We had an agreement.
Walt,"I didn't agree to anything. Now, look, just come on inside and we'll talk this through, okay?"
Skyler,No. No. There's nothing to talk about. I am not coming in there until you get out.
Walt,"Well, suit yourself."
Skyler,Walt. Walt?
Skyler,What is wrong with you?
Walt,"Skyler, I have every right to be here."
Skyler,"No, you don't. You don't live here anymore. We're getting a divorce."
Walt,I don't agree to a divorce.
Skyler,"Well, it's not up to you! If you don't get out of here right now, I'm gonna call the police and I'm going to tell them everything. I mean it, Walt."
Walt,There's the phone.
Skyler,It's ringing.
Operator,Albuquerque Police Department. Operator number 314. How may I help you? Albuquerque Police Department. How may I help you?
Skyler,"Yes, I want to report a disturbance, please. No, no, it's not exactly, it's a domestic issue. Okay. They're connecting me. Right hand to God, I will tell them."
Walt,"Do what you have to do, Skyler. This family is everything to me. Without it, I have nothing to lose."
Skyler,Fine. Yes. My name is Skyler White. I need police assistance at my home right away. My soon-to-be ex-husband broke into my house and I need an officer to come and remove him. It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane. Okay. Okay. Thank you. They're coming.
Walter Junior,Dad's here? Dad.
Walt,"Hey, son. How are you?"
Walter Junior,Are you back for good?
Skyler,Why are you home so soon?
Walter Junior,I'm not.
Walt,"Hey, I am starving. How about a grilled cheese?"
Walter Junior,Sure.
Walt,You want one too?
Skyler,"Walter. Your dad and I have something we need to discuss. When your sandwich is ready, I'll bring it to your room."
Walter Junior,"Mom, can't it wait? I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever."
Skyler,Walter?
Walt,How was school?
Walter Junior,It was good.
Walt,Yeah? Homework?
Walter Junior,"No, not really."
Walt,Not really? What does that mean?
Walter Junior,So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?
Walt,"Yeah, that's the plan."
Cop,"Hello, ma'am. We were called about a disturbance?"
Skyler,"It's more of a trespassing situation, really, but yeah, that was me."
Walter Junior,You called the cops on Dad?
Skyler,"I came home from work and he was back. He had just moved back into the house. And I asked him to leave, but he won't listen. I just want him out. I want him out of the house."
Cop,"Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple questions I need to ask you. It's very important you answer honestly. Did he strike you?"
Skyler,No.
Cop,Has he ever hit you?
Skyler,No. This is not about violence. This is about trespassing. About him being here against my will.
Cop,"Okay. Trespassing. You're divorced, then?"
Skyler,"No, working on it. Right now, we’re separated."
Cop,Legally separated?
Skyler,"There's not a court order, if that's what you mean. But we've been living apart for almost two weeks, give or take. I changed the locks. Isn't that breaking and entering?"
Cop,Whose name is on the title to the house?
Skyler,Both of us. It's jointly owned.
Cop,We can't arrest a man for breaking into his own house. Not without a court order requiring he stays away. Unless he's threatened you or the kids.
Skyler,"No. Not physically. But having him in the house is just, it's not a good thing. Excuse me."
Walt,"I got her, honey. Come here. Here we go. You hungry? You hungry? Here we go. That was it. I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?"
Other Cop,Disagreements.
Walt,"Yes, well, we've had our share of that. I haven't been the most attentive husband lately."
Cop,"Mrs. White, would this be easier if we stepped outside for a minute?"
Skyler,No. Nope. I'm fine right here.
Cop,"I'm gonna level with you, ma'am. If you want him out of the house, you'll have to help me. Is it possible maybe he's broken any laws that you know of? Anything at all. Anything that we could work with here, just tell me. Even if it's just a suspicion, I can work with that. I'll get him out of the house for you."
Other Cop,What's your take on all this?
Walter Junior,"It's my mom's fault. She won't even say what my dad did and it's because he didn't do anything. I don't know why she's being this way. My dad, he is a great guy."
Walt,"Son, it's not your mom's fault."
Cop,"Mrs. White. I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no legal basis for us to remove your husband from the house. Next time you feel things are getting out of control you should call this number. It's the family hotline. I'd really look into some counseling. Best of luck to you folks."
Walt,"Listen, thank you, officers. We're sorry."
Walter Junior,Why you gotta do this to Dad?
Walt,"Junior, wait, come on. Don't blame your mother for this. Sorry."
Skyler,Welcome home.
Saul,"He lives. Happy housewarming, kid. Don't look so glad to see me."
Jesse,Thanks.
Saul,"Interesting decor. It's subtle. The whole minimalist thing never really blew my hair back, but hey. So how are you doing? Staying clean? Good. I was kind of worried that you were back to old habits since I didn't hear from you, you know. You realise how stupid it is to ignore your counsel's phone calls? What if I was trying to warn you that the DEA was gonna kick down your door? What then?"
Jesse,Why don't you spare me the sermon and get to why you're here?
Saul,"Fair enough. Remember the other day when I brought up the idea of you getting back in touch with your partner? Well, I kind of wanted to re-float that boat. I'm not suggesting you yourself get back to cooking. I mean, you being in rehab and all. I only want you to convince the master chef to do his thing. So, what do you say?"
Jesse,"Sure, man. Whatever."
Saul,"Okay. Whatever what? I mean, you gonna call him?"
Jesse,"I said I'll handle it. Now, bounce, will you? Please?"
Saul,"Final thought. Look at this place. You're house-poor, you got no bankroll. If you get the maestro cooking again, I'll make it worth your while. Call him."
Jane’s Voicemail,"If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you  ""Do Not Call list."" However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep."
Hank,"Schrader. Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up? Yeah? That's great news, sir. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, you can bet on that. Hey, listen, thanks again, sir I really appreciate you stepping to the plate. Thank you."
Steve,So you gonna keep me in suspense or what? What's the good news?
Hank,Merkert called in a couple of favors. El Paso wants me back.
Steve,"Hey, man, congrats, man. That's fantastic."
Hank,Thank you.
Gus,Hello. Gentlemen. Welcome. Thank you for coming. Any difficulty at the border?
Bolsa,The day I can't get across the border is the day I retire.
Gus,"Please, come in. I apologize that it's not wheelchair accessible."
Bolsa,"My apologies, Gustavo. Of course, you should have been advised. It's your territory, you had a right to bless the order. But we had no reason to believe the man was of concern to you."
Gus,"Indeed, he is."
Bolsa,So you're in business with this Heisenberg.
Gus,"I don't know him by that name, but yes. I've made no secret of the fact that I have always done business with certain local manufacturers. You and I, we still make money together. It's never affected our relationship."
Bolsa,Don Salamanca had a nephew named Tuco.
Gus,"Yes, I knew of him."
Bolsa,"Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca mentored him in the business. Thought of Tuco as a son. When Don Salamanca was no longer able, Tuco took over for his uncle. He was a key man in our organization north of the border. He was loyal. This Heisenberg, Walter White he was one of Tuco's local suppliers. Until he betrayed Tuco. So now you see, blood must be repaid by blood. Tuco's cousins here, they have the right to exact vengeance. The Salamanca family, the cartel, everyone stands shoulder to shoulder on this."
Gus,Don Salamanca. Gentlemen. I feel your loss deeply. Please accept my condolences. I have no issue with your right to vengeance. But I am presently engaged in business with this man. When our business is done he will no longer be of any concern to me. Until then I need him alive.
Bolsa,"Excuse us. I don't tell you how to fry your chickens, Gustavo. You should really leave matters of my organization's politics to me."
Gus,Do I not run my own territory?
Bolsa,Of course you do. And I will advise them to be patient. But I recommend you finish your business with the man quickly. Or you risk losing the good graces of the cartel. That would not be wise. And those boys inside I cannot guarantee that they will listen. They are not like you and I.
Jane’s Voicemail,"If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you  ""Do Not Call list."" However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you  ""Do Not Call list. "" However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you…”"
Skyler,"Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay, my girl. Yes, it's okay. It's okay. Mama's got you. I've got you. Yes. Yes."
Walt,"Skyler? Want some help? Skyler, can I use the bathroom? God."
Lawyer,What do you mean? Against your will?
Skyler,Yes. Very much against my will. He just showed right back up. And he doesn't want a divorce. Won't even consider it. I called the police on him. I was so close…
Lawyer,So close to what?
Skyler,Nothing. Never mind.
Lawyer,"Skyler, I can't advise you properly if you don't give me all the facts. Understand, I'm bound by the attorney-client privilege to keep everything you tell me a secret. I can't tell a soul unless you authorize me to."
Skyler,Even if it's something illegal?
Lawyer,"Especially if it's illegal. I'm your lawyer, not the police. My job is to protect you."
Skyler,My husband makes meth. Methamphetamine.
Lawyer,Your husband's a drug dealer?
Skyler,"A manufacturer, technically. They call them cooks. I looked it up on the Internet."
Lawyer,"This is my advice, and you should take it  Sue your husband for divorce immediately. Let me go to the police and tell them what you just told me. I'll go in ex parte to get a restraining order from the court today. If he comes anywhere near you and your children, he'll go straight to jail. No questions asked. This is a no-brainer. It's the best thing for you and your family."
Skyler,"I can't. I can't do it. I don't want my son to find out that his father is a criminal. I just, I can't do that to him."
Lawyer,"In the end, it may not be up to you. Drug dealers have a way of getting caught."
Skyler,"Walt has lung cancer. His treatment bought him some time. But the doctors, they all say that sooner or later. I can't see why I should lay all this on my family when things may resolve themselves on their own without anyone else knowing."
Steve,"Man, did I lose a bet or something? What are we doing in this sh*thole?"
Hank,"Relax, will you?"
Steve,"Relax? This is the kind of place you get knifed. We should have went to Chili's, man."
Hank,"All right, already. Jesus."
Steve,Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late. They got that Blooming Onion.
Hank,What's wrong with spicing things up a little?
Steve,This spice looks like it's been through a couple of guys already. So when you headed back down to El Paso?
Hank,"You know. Between all the packing, errands, getting the ducks in a row maybe a week or two."
Steve,"Week or two? Come on, man. I'd be dying to get back in the action. It's not like there's nothing going on up here."
Hank,What are you talking about?
Steve,Ain't jack going on up here. It's quiet as hell.
Hank,I'm gonna hit the head. Those two over there. I think they're holding.
Steve,"Man, in this place, the bartender's probably holding. All right."
Hank,What you doing?
Steve,Calling A.P.D. What do you think?
Hank,Since when can't we handle a couple dirtballs?
Steve,"Come on, man. Courtesy call. What if Vice is running some kind of undercover op?"
Hank,Screw it. It's your turn to pay.
Steve,Where you going?
Hank,Gotta take a leak.
Steve,"Jesus, get yourself some Flomax."
Hank,Stand up.
Guy,"You got a problem with us, bitch?"
Hank,Your move. DEA. Don't move. Go out and tell my partner to get his ass in here.
Jane’s Voicemail,"If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you  ""Do Not Call list."" However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you  ""Do Not Call…”"
Recording,"The number you have reached, 149-4985 in area code 505 is no longer…"
Walt,Skyler. Can we talk?
Steve,ASAC wants to see you.
Hank,And?
Steve,"We were hanging back, saw a deal go down. I went outside to call it in. You stayed to keep an eye on the suspects. That's when they attacked you. What I didn't tell him is that you left your g*n under the seat before you went back inside."
Walt,"I've done a terrible thing. But I did it for a good reason. I did it for us. That is college tuition for Walter Jr and Holly 18 years down the road. That is health insurance for you and the kids. For Junior's physical therapy, his SAT tutor. It's money for groceries, for gas, for birthdays and graduation parties. Skyler, that money is for this roof over your head. The mortgage you aren't gonna be able to afford on a part-time bookkeeper's salary when I'm gone."
Skyler,"Walt, I…"
Walt,"Please. Please. This money, I didn't steal it. It doesn't belong to anyone else. I earned it. The things I've done to earn, the things that I've had to do I've got to live with them. Skyler, all that I've done, all the sacrifices that I have made for this family all of it will be for nothing if you don't accept what I've earned. Please. I'll be here when you get home from work. You can give me your answer then."
Ted,"Hey, Sky."
Skyler,Are your kids home?
Louis,"Hey, Mrs. White."
Skyler,"Hey, Louis."
Louis,"Hey, thanks for having me over for dinner."
Skyler,Sure.
Walt,"Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner. Pot roast. So how was your day?"
Skyler,Good.
Walt,"Good. Excellent. I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis to stay for dinner tonight. You know, as a thank you for driving Walter Jr. to school for us. We've been kind of absent but, I tell you, Louis really pitched in. Look, I just wanna say that I feel good about our talk this morning and I'm very eager to hear what you're thinking about what we talked about. But, you know, whenever you're ready, of course. Honesty is good. Don't you think?"
Skyler,"I f*cked Ted. Boys, dinner. Iced tea?"
Walter Junior,Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Skyler,Louis?
Louis,"Yes, please."
Skyler,"All right. I want you boys both to eat your salad, okay? Okay. I know nobody likes salad but it's good for you."
Cara,So cigarettes and gas is $79.
Jesse,70. Crap.
Cara,There's an ATM right outside.
Jesse,"Yeah, I don't have a card."
Cara,"Well, you can write a personal check with ID."
Jesse,"Kind of in between banks right now. You think I could just come back later? I'm totally good for it. I'd come back, I swear."
Cara,"If it were me, I'd be totally, you know, ""No problem."" But my dad is this ginormous hard-ass. He was in Fallujah for a year. And he always checks the receipts. I mean, like, always. I gotta call him. I'm sorry."
Jesse,"Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. Maybe we could trade. Ever try it?"
Cara,"I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes. I party. But that stuff's really addictive, right?"
Jesse,Not really. It's just a media thing. You know?
Cara,What's it like?
Jesse,It's awesome. Everything's maximum interesting. You get these really cold and sharp-like action dagger feelings. It's awesome. Come on. What do you say? Have a nice day.
Saul,So how does it feel? Does it hurt?
Antonio,"Yeah, it's tight."
Saul,"Yeah, but is it painful?"
Antonio,It's hard to breathe.
Saul,"Well, you need your breathing. Although let's not lose sight of the fact that you were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio, so some discomfort is to be expected. Let's go with that one. A cashier's check, por favor. Oh, and spread the word. I'm building a class-action, flight 515. Victims' families would be great. I'll take anyone on the ground who suffered emotionally. Anxiety, sleeplessness. You get the picture. Trouble?"
Walt,Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious. That guy is a joke.
Skyler,You know what? You called my bluff.
Walt,What does that even mean?
Skyler,"You dared me to tell the police and I couldn't do it, so you win. If you want to stay in this house, fine, but we are not married anymore."
Walt,"I told you that I was done cooking meth, Skyler. I promised you that."
Skyler,So what?
Walt,"You know what? At least I didn't run off to go…Jesus! I mean, everything that I did, I did for this family."
Skyler,Just keep telling yourself that.
Walt,What is that supposed to mean?
Skyler,"You don't like it, then leave. And take your drug money with you."
Walt,That's what you want.
Saul,Jesus.
Mike,Garbage disposal.
Walt,"You think this will get me to move out? You can screw Ted. You can screw the butcher, the mailman."
Skyler,"God, Walt."
Walt,Whoever you want. Screw them all. I'm not going anywhere.
Skyler,Suit yourself.
Saul,Is this a good or bad thing?
Walt,Suit myself. You want me to suit myself? I'll suit myself to his face!
Saul,It's a bad thing.
Walt,Hello. Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
Margaret,I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.
Walt,Okay. I will wait.
Margaret,It could be a while.
Walt,I have all the time in the world. Okay. Here we go. Okay.
Margaret,Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's not available.
Walt,Ted? Come on.
Margaret,"Sir, excuse me. Excuse me."
Walt,"Ted, I can see you. I can see you standing right there in your office. Now, come on. Open the door. Come on, let's talk. I just want to talk. That's all. Come on, let's be men about this. Okay? How about that?"
Ted,"Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle of something now."
Walt,"Oh, yes, you are. So open the door. You're damn right. You're right in the middle. Just open the door and let's talk about it, okay? Open the door, Ted, right now. You don't want to be a man about it? Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B."
Margaret,We have a situation.
Walt,"I'm talking with Ted. Next time, you'll open the door."
Employee,Freeze!
Walt,"Come on. Oh, damn it. No, I'm just here to talk. I just want to talk to him."
Employee,Outside. Let's go.
Walt,God. Can I just talk? I just want to talk to him.
Employee,Calm down.
Walt,"Okay, all right. All right, all right, all right. I'm calm. I'm calm. assh*le. What do you want? What do you want? Hey! Hey, come on."
Saul,"What the hell is wrong with you? You act like you're the first guy this happened to. I caught my second wife screwing my stepdad, okay? It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up."
Walt,I just wanted to talk to him.
Saul,"Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you. Consider this an intervention. You could have been arrested back there. You understand. Speaking as your lawyer, I'm always looking for billable hours. But speaking as your business associate I'm strongly advising that you get your shit together. Just cool it with this Beneke guy, at least for now. Okay? Let's talk shop, because I think this is a great opportunity to channel some of that negative energy into something positive."
Walt,How did you know?
Saul,Sorry?
Walt,About Skyler. About where to find me just now. How did you know?
Saul,"That's just my meticulousness. Don't bog down in detail, Walt. The lesson here should be…"
Walt,Did you bug my house?
Saul,"Yeah! But I didn't know it was your house, did I? You'd moved out. Besides, you basically told me to."
Walt,I told you to?
Saul,You strongly hinted that I should. You were worried your wife might say something to the police.
Walt,"What? No, no, that's not true. When the hell did I say that?"
Saul,"Let's not get lost in the who, what and whens. The point is we did our due diligence and she didn't talk. She kept quiet. She stood by you, Walt. Which, if you ask me, is the ironical silver lining here. I mean, on the one hand sure, she snuck off the reservation to get some dirty, damp and deep. On the other hand.. Off me!"
Walt,You're fired! You're done!
Saul,"Good! ""Oh, boohoo, I won't cook meth anymore"". You're a crybaby! Who needs you? And I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?"
Walt,I want those bugs out of my house today. I want them out now!
Saul,"You just bought a $300 suit, psycho! Go."
Walt,"Great, drilled right into the stucco."
Mike,"A little bit of putty, you'll be fine."
Walt,Just make sure you get all of those things.
Mike,"A, these things cost $800 apiece. B, you're not that interesting. So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter."
Walt,"Great line of work, by the way. Real upstanding field."
Mike,"Yeah, well I enjoy it."
Walt,You're free to leave now. Anytime.
Mike,"You know, Walter, sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone watching your back."
Carmen,Mr. White?
Walt,Hi. What's up?
Carmen,"I can't begin to understand what you're going through, Walt with all of your health concerns and the stresses you've been under. But still, as educators there are certain responsibilities we need to be meeting here to the school and to the students themselves."
Walt,Of course. Is this a wheaten terrier?
Carmen,Norfolk.
Walt,Norfolk? That's surprising.
Carmen,"Walt, could you come back over here and have a seat, please?"
Walt,Sure.
Carmen,"You've been absent a lot recently. And when you are here at school, there have been some behavioral questions. And frankly I'm concerned."
Walt,Thank you.
Carmen,Are you feeling okay? Do you think maybe I should call Skyler?
Walt,No. Let's just keep this…
Carmen,"What? Hey! Walt, what's wrong with you?"
Hank,"You know, look, you're the one always talking about D.C, okay? This is how you get there. You answer the bell. You pay your dues. Besides, you know, it's a big deal to get picked for this. El Paso's like the Super Bowl. I could get k*lled crossing the street, okay? Whatever. You know, I want to go."
Marie,What about last time?
Hank,"What about last time? Schrader. Hey, sheriff. Yeah. Blue, huh? Yeah, yeah. Thing is, I'm supposed to be getting on a plane right now. The stuff this guy had was blue. You sure about that? Yeah. Yeah, I want to talk to him. Taxi."
Walt,Hi.
Jesse,"Man, I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you, but you weren't at your apartment."
Walt,"No, I moved back home."
Jesse,"That's good, right?"
Walt,Yeah.
Jesse,"Yo, did you just get fired?"
Walt,"No. No, no, no. It's more like a sabbatical. Indefinite. Yeah. So, what's up?"
Jesse,Should we go somewhere?
Walt,"No, this is fine."
Jesse,So I want an intro to your guy.
Walt,What guy?
Jesse,Your guy. Your distribution guy. The guy Saul hooked you up with.
Walt,"No, no, no. Come on, Jesse."
Jesse,I thought about it and I want to. It's the one thing I'm good at.
Walt,"No, that is just not true. You're good at a lot of things, son."
Jesse,Like what?
Walt,What about your sobriety?
Jesse,"I told you, I'm not using. Ever. I just want back into the business."
Walt,"Well, I don't. I'm sorry."
Jesse,"I know, and that's cool. I'm not asking you to cook."
Walt,What's this?
Jesse,"In the end, I just went with two reflux condensers. I didn't want to lose track of my pH levels. But I did everything else just like you taught me. Super careful in my amounts and watched the numbers every step of the way. So, what do you think? It's good, right?"
Walt,What in the hell is this?
Jesse,What?
Walt,What? This. This. This is my product. This is my formula. This is mine.
Jesse,"It's our product, but yeah, I was gonna cut you in."
Walt,"Oh, you were gonna cut me in? No, no, no. I cut you in."
Jesse,What the hell is your problem? All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.
Walt,Absolutely not.
Jesse,Why?
Walt,"Because I am not gonna lend my name to an inferior product. I mean, look at the diameters here. What did you use for reduction? Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?"
Jesse,No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam. The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.
Walt,"All right, well, you must've done it wrong, then. Your color is all cloudy, so you were struggling with distillation too. Now, this is very shoddy work, Pinkman. I'm actually embarrassed for you."
Jesse,What? No way. I gave out samples and everyone said it was the b*mb.
Walt,"Oh, they said it was the b*mb. And who were they, I wonder? A bunch of meth heads?"
Jesse,"Yeah. Yeah. They should know, right?"
Walt,"Yeah, well, sorry. I can't help you."
Jesse,"Fine, ass-wad. I'll contact the guy myself."
Walt,"Oh, yeah? Well, good luck. Because my guy is a pro and he doesn't deal with junkies."
Jesse,You know what? Eat me.
Walt,"Anytime, loser. Hey, hey, hey! Wait. Hey!"
Skyler,I can't believe it's only 4 00. This day is dragging.
Skyler,Okay. I wish I could stay.
Ted,So stay. What's stopping you?
Skyler,"What, like everything, you mean? How about my lunatic husband refusing to leave the house?"
Ted,So move in here.
Skyler,And then my son hating me even more.
Ted,That'll pass. I went through that with the girls. They adapt.
Skyler,And now everyone at work thinks I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.
Ted,"They're all fired, effective immediately. What else?"
Skyler,"Oh, aren't you the answer man?"
Ted,"Where did it go wrong, exactly, with you and Walt? I mean, I always saw him as kind of mild-mannered. Something, I don't know, changed when he got sick or?"
Skyler,"I don't know what changed, Ted. And I just don't feel really comfortable talking about it."
Ted,Sorry. Just asking out of self-interest. Gotta make sure I don't make the same mistake.
Skyler,I would be amazed.
Hank,"Just let me see if I'm following you here, Russell. You got this stuff from some guy at Gasparza's who was wearing tan pants and who you're 80 percent sure had a mustache. That's it, right? That's your brain working at maximum capacity? Russell. Everything all right in there?"
Hank,"Well, there you go. See? You served an actual earthly function."
Russell,I can't believe I remembered that.
Hank,Mel who? Does he have a last name?
Russell,"Yeah, Mel. Wait. Was it Mel or Mark? It was definitely an M name. Oh, man, I'm losing it. Wait, wait. Yeah. It's gone. It's gone. It was an M name though. Yeah. I remember the muh sound."
Hank,"All right, well, we'll go with the muh sound. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it."
Russell,Yeah. He definitely had tan pants.
Hank,"Remind me to get a vasectomy. Okay, it's after 9, so this bar that Girl George is at probably wall-to-wall dirtbags by now. Let's go have a little looky-loo, see if we can't find this M-named clown."
Steve,What?
Hank,"It's a lead
.
Steve  Lead to what?"
Hank,"To Heisenberg. I told you it was only a matter of time before this guy booted up again. Here we go, my friend. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful, Gomey. Just apologize and buy me a beer."
Steve,"Man, you're reaching. This stuff could be a knockoff or left over from an older cook. How do you know Heisenberg's gearing up again?"
Hank,How do I know? Because I know.
Steve,I don't get it. This is the reason why you're blowing off the task force? Chase down teeners? I'm getting tired of all the second-guessing.
Hank,If you're not sufficiently stimulated by this investigation do us both a favor and ask for a transfer.
Steve,"What is up with you lately? Starting bar fights, turning down El Paso and now this bullshit? Do you need to talk to someone or what?"
Hank,Talk to someone? Talk to who?
Steve,"I'm not trying to step on your toes, bro. Okay? I'm just worried about you. That's all."
Hank,"Appreciate that, bro. Now take your hand off my shoulder."
Saul,"Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV. Did any little piece fall on your property? I'm not looking for an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas. It could be a nut or a bolt. It could be a bag of peanuts just so long as it caused you pain and suffering. Oh, no, no, no. Closed. Calling you back. You had your chance. I told you to get him cooking again. You blew it off and now it's too late. The guy's gone mass maniac on us! All I wanted was to show you two your potential. And what do I get in return? A bone contusion. You wanna see the scar? I wish you two had…Hi, there. How in the hell did you get Walt to…"
Jesse,"I made it. You know the guy who knows the guy, right?"
Mike,"Well, good news is for stage-three cancer, the guy's doing well physically. Mentally, the guy's a disaster. He's gone off the rails over this thing with his wife. My opinion, he's not coming back. Not on his own. Your friends were at his place again, by the way. They drew something on the street outside his house. A scythe."
Gus,Animals. Does the lawyer know?
Mike,Should he?
Gus,No.
Mike,"If you want this guy to produce again, why not just tell him? You stand between him and an ax in the head."
Gus,"I don't believe fear to be an effective motivator. I want investment. For now, I'm simply interested in the time frame. He will live for the foreseeable future, yes?"
Mike,"Foreseeable. Couple years at least, barring acts of God and men with axes. From the lawyer, I'm supposed to let you know the Pinkman kid is looking to sell."
Gus,I don't work with junkies.
Mike,"That's what I thought you'd say. Probably for the best. What I hear, he and Walter are splitsville."
Gus,Really?
Mike,That's what Goodman says. Cats and dogs.
Gus,Do the deal.
Voice,You have one unheard message.
Merkert,"Agent Schrader, you need to be calling me back ASAP. I've got Texas breathing down my neck and I'm not about…"
Cara,"No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad fired him, like, a while ago."
Hank,"Where can I find him, you think?"
Cara,No idea. Haven't seen him.
Hank,I know. You said that a few times.
Cara,"Yeah, because I haven't seen him. I don't know what else to say."
Hank,"What's your name, darling?"
Cara,Cara.
Hank,"Where did this come from, Cara?"
Cara,I don't know. What is it? Drugs?
Hank,"Look, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. You're a bad liar, Cara. Don't get me wrong. Not the worst I've ever seen. Once I had a guy try to explain the dope balloon up his butt on bad Thai food. Still, you're not a very good liar."
Cara,I honestly don't know…
Hank,Stop. You look like a good kid. I'm not here to get you in trouble. But you need to tell me where this came from right now!
Cara,"I never do stuff like this. I swear to God. I tried it and I hated it, so I just gave it to Matt."
Hank,"Okay, and who gave it to you?"
Cara,Some guy. He came in a couple days ago and wanted to trade it for gas.
Hank,"Some guy? What's his name? Okay, what? What did he look like?"
Cara,"I don't know. He looked pretty normal. You know, white. I think his hair was lightish brown. He had really blue eyes. They were really, really blue."
Hank,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy. Okay, what else? Piercings, jewelry, distinctive articles of clothing. Come on. Come on. Listen to me. It's real important that I find the person that had these drugs. So if you can remember anything else. Come on, think. Come on, now. Come on."
Cara,He drove an RV.
Hank,"Okay, good, good. What can you remember? What kind of RV? What color? Did you spot a license plate?"
Cara,"I don't know the kinds and I didn't see the license. But the color was, I think, white, brownish color. I'm sorry. I know I'm not helping you but, please, don't tell my dad."
Hank,"Cara. Please, tell me that that camera works."
Hank,Damn it. Bingo.
Walter Junior,"These eggs are good, Mom."
Skyler,Thanks.
Walter Junior,"Hey, you know what's weird? Dad's website. It's been three days since the last donation."
Walt,"Yeah, well, people lose interest."
Walter Junior,So how long are you off for?
Walt,"A few weeks. I'll play it by ear. I probably pushed it, you know, going back to work too soon."
Walter Junior,Think I can get a ride today? Louis has a doctor's appointment.
Walt,Yeah.
Walter Junior,"Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right? You won't have to take Holly to work every day."
Skyler,"Sometime, maybe. Yeah, we'll see."
Jesse,"What's up? I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo. Wait. No, no. No way. Hey! Hey! Hey. What the hell? This is only half."
Victor,That's right. It's your half.
Jesse,"Yo, where's the other half, bitch?"
Hank,"I mean, the whole thing was crazy. Poor b*st*rd. I felt sorry for him. I think he actually thought we were the cable guys, you know. Anyway, sorry about those missed calls, chief. I'm changing providers. It won't happen again."
Merkert,"Are you going to El Paso, Hank?"
Hank,"Hell, yes. With pointy boots and bells on. Got this break in the Heisenberg case."
Merkert,"The blue meth, you mean? The teenth?"
Hank,"Yeah, well, that teenth got things rolling. I traced it to a gas station in Cibola. That's where I got these. The station's closed-circuit was down. Surprise, surprise. But I was able to pull some of these snapshots off an ATM security camera. We always thought these guys might be camper-cooking. First off, your typical Class C motorhome is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds of interior fixtures. Appliances, furniture, built-ins, See how high that suspension's riding? No way, no how, this thing's carrying that kind of weight. This thing has been cleared out and stripped down to its tight-and-curlies. For what? Blood bank? Maybe a bookmobile?"
Merkert,There's no clear view of the plates.
Hank,"Yeah, well, you can only get so lucky, right? But there's no front plate. Tells me it's likely New Mexico registration. I checked with the DMV. There are only 29 of these early-'80s Bounders registered in the state."
Merkert,Only 29?
Hank,"Yeah. So I gotta go, you know, knock on some doors."
Merkert,"They need you in El Paso, Hank."
Hank,You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up this Heisenberg thing first.
Merkert,You're refusing the assignment.
Hank,I'm not. I'll go. It's just I need some more time.
Merkert,"You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader. You're out of time. Are you going to El Paso now, tonight? It's a simple yes or no."
Hank,No. I can't. But that's only because I'm really close to something big here.
Merkert,"Better get to it, then."
Radio,"This is KEC A 480, Albuquerque's news radio. KEC A news time, 10 13. Our top story this hour, Donald Margolis the air-traffic controller criticized for his role in the recent air disaster in which 167 persons died was rushed to an area hospital early this morning apparently the victim of a self-inflicted g*nsh*t*t wound. Police won't say whether or not…"
Victor,Your half.
Walt,I am awake.
Jesse,"You are not how I remember you from class. I mean, like, not at all. Dude, this isn't even 7 grand, all right? My guy wants 85."
Walt,This is all the money I have in the world. You are a drug dealer. Negotiate. Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.
Jesse,"Work it, work it, baby."
Skinny Pete,"Yo, this is sick, brother."
Jesse,Totally. God.
Combo,"Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies who wanna participate. You got the funds?"
Jesse,"Oh, I got the funds. Hey. Would you ladies like to meet my fat stack? Get in here. Come on. Hey, yo, yo. Yo, you got champagne? None of that cheap stuff. I want the expensive shit. Don Perignon."
Waitress,It's 400 a bottle.
Jesse,"Oh, well, in that case, I'll only have two. Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses. I like those skinny glasses! That's what James Bond drinks. Mofos, I'm all about that."
Combo,"Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask. Where did you get all the cheddar?"
Skinny Pete,Must be moving mad volume.
Jesse,It's funny. You wanna know what's funny?
Combo,What's funny?
Jesse,"This old dude, he gave it to me."
Skinny Pete,What?
Jesse,He gave it to me. It's his entire life savings.
Combo,What? Why?
Jesse,"Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why. Oh, God. Yes! All right, living large, players. Thank you. Yo, thank you. Thank you."
Skinny Pete,"That was…*throws up* Awesome, bro. Later."
Jesse,"Oh, man. Oh, I'm so dead. I only got…Oh, damn. I only got, like, 1400."
Combo,Waffle House? Yeah.
Jesse,"No, man. Supposed to use that dude's money to buy an RV."
Combo,What do you want with a RV for?
Jesse,"Because, like because, like never mind. Jesus. Now I gotta, like, leave town or change my identity or something. Guy's blackmailing me. He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo."
Combo,"RV, yeah? I can hook you up, bro. I can totally get you an RV."
Jesse,"No, I need it today. Now."
Combo,No problem. Let's go.
Jesse,"You're telling me you can get me an RV? For 1400, at 6 in the morning?"
Jesse,Right on. So do I need to sign something?
Combo,"No, it's, like, a no-paperwork-type deal. Pleasure doing business with you. Come on, we gotta bounce."
Jesse,What?
Combo,"For real, yo. Get it out of here."
Skyler,"Oh, my God, I love this floor. This feels fantastic. Can you control the temperature?"
Ted,Yeah. There should be a switch right next to you there. It's a thermostat.
Skyler,"Ted, this has gotta be the most amazing invention ever."
Ted,"I know. Contractor talked me into it. Seemed kind of extravagant, but I gotta tell you, once you try it, you can't go back."
Skyler,I can never find anything in this Buick.
Ted,"You know, you could leave a few things here if you want."
Skyler,Why don't you go get your dad?
Walter Junior,"Sure. Hey, Dad. Dad?"
Walt,Yeah.
Walter Junior,Mom's asking. Wanna come to dinner?
Walt,"Yeah, I'll be right there. You're not listening to me. I don't know."
Jesse,"Yeah, right, like you don't know."
Walt,What did I just say?
Saul,Give me the phone. Give it.
Jesse,Like you didn't make some deal behind my back.
Walt,"Correct. I did not. I was sitting at a stoplight minding my own business, when the man, the kid, threw a bag of money through my window."
Jesse,"Whatever, man. You owe me that money."
Saul,Let me talk to him.
Walt,I owe you? I owe you nothing. And I will get to the bottom of this. Trust me.
Jesse,"Trust you? Trust you? That's a good one. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do."
Walt,"You wanna talk about trust, Jesse? Let's talk about trust. I told you not to cook my formula, and you went ahead and did it anyway."
Jesse,"Because I never said I wouldn't cook it because it ain't yours. It's ours. Plural, bitch!"
Walt,You did not have my permission.
Jesse,All I know is I got half the money I'm due and you got the rest.
Saul,Escalating. You're escalating.
Jesse,"You know what? Escalate this. My meth, my money! I will be a one-man glass factory. I will rock that RV 24…"
Hank,It's buttoned up tight. Can't see a damn thing.
Steve,"I ain't feeling it. No smoke, no smell, no waste. There's no cook."
Hank,Could be they're setting up. I heard movement inside.
Steve,"I say we call it a night, come back with a search warrant."
Hank,I'm not letting this sucker out of my sight. There's gotta be a way. There's gotta be a way. There's gotta be a way…
Steve,"Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?"
Guy,"No, no, no. What the hell are you doing up there? Are you some kind of a pervert?"
Hank,"Sorry. I appreciate Going after the bad guys. I'm sorry and enjoy the rest of your vacation. Okay? Go back to your trailers. Everything's okay. Guy's VFW. He's cool. We're gonna check out a couple more and call it a morning. Okay, what do you say?"
Steve,Can't. Gotta get home.
Hank,"Why, you leave your balls in your wife's purse or what?"
Steve,Gotta pack.
Hank,Where you headed?
Steve,Texas.
Marie,Hey there. Hank? Hank? Can I come in?
Hank,"Hey, babe."
Marie,Hey. How did it go last night?
Hank,Good.
Marie,Catch the bad guys?
Hank,Nope.
Marie,Want me to make you some breakfast?
Hank,No. I'm heading back out after this.
Marie,"Now? You worked all night. Get some sleep, Hank. Those RVs aren't going anywhere."
Hank,"They're recreational vehicles, Marie. That's what they do."
Marie,You know what I mean. I spoke with Blanca. She said that Steve's going to El Paso?
Hank,Yeah.
Marie,I was just wondering how you feel about that.
Hank,I turned it down. End of story.
Marie,"Good. Good. Jesus, God knows I'm relieved."
Hank,I needed some time here because I'm deep into this investigation and couldn't do both so I made a judgment call.
Marie,"You know that you can talk to me about things, right? You don't have to go through this alone."
Hank,"Do you ask me which lead bib to put on someone before you nuke them? Jesus, Marie. I made a decision. I'm not going through anything. Doing my job."
Marie,I would like…
Hank,I know. I know. A condo in Georgetown. I know.
Marie,"If you would let me finish, I was going to say I'd like to be included. That's all."
Hank,Don't you worry about my career. My career is just fine.
Marie,Did you not wanna go? I don't blame you. I just…
Hank,Aren't you late for work or something?
Marie,After what happened it would make perfect sense for you to not wanna go back.
Hank,"I'm onto some important stuff right here, right now. And Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to do with it. Anyone who doubts that, I mean, I'm doing some actual good out here and all I get are these bullshit accusations! What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine. But I'm onto something. I know it. You understand me? You hear me?"
Walt,What exactly is this? I'll tell you what I think it is. A ploy. A ploy to get me cooking again. And an obvious one at that.
Gus,How do you mean?
Walt,As if I would seriously believe you would hire an addict. Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.
Gus,You vouched for him previously. I took you at your word.
Walt,"No. No, no, no. Let me be clear. Let me be perfectly clear. Jesse was capable of working under my supervision. Trusting him with a solo venture well, that's quite another matter. How he could possibly produce anything other than a mediocre product at best."
Gus,I am told his product was more or less consistent with the quality I had come to expect.
Walt,"More or less? More or less? Really? Boy, that is the…talk about setting the bar low. Except you don't do that, set the bar low. Therefore, what conclusion am I left to draw? That you believe I have some proprietary kind of selfishness about my own formula. Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose that you think simply overwhelms me, clouds my judgment. But it doesn't. Absolutely not. I simply respect the chemistry. The chemistry must be respected."
Gus,I apologize for being so transparent. Would you take a drive with me? I'd like to show you something.
Skyler,Hi. Is everything okay?
Marie,"She's already finished an entire bottle, but she still seemed hungry. Then she fell asleep. But I was thinking I'd give her another when she wakes up."
Skyler,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Fatten that baby up."
Marie,Will do.
Skyler,Was that it?
Marie,So where are you? Are you at work?
Skyler,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work. I shouldn't be much longer. Is that okay?"
Marie,You know I love my little pookums. You can leave her with me for the next 18 years as far as I'm concerned.
Skyler,"Great. Thanks, Marie. Are you sure you're okay? Sweetie, what is it? Come on."
Marie,It's Hank.
Skyler,Hank? What about him?
Marie,"I don't know how to talk to him. I don't know what to say to him anymore. I don't know how to…ever since El Paso, ever since. Maybe before."
Skyler,Yeah. God knows he went through a lot down there.
Marie,"People blown up right in front of him, blood everywhere and last week, El Paso said they want him back."
Skyler,Yeah?
Marie,He's not going. Steve Gomez is going in his place and I don't know how I feel about that.
Skyler,"Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here, isn't he?"
Marie,"Of course, and I want him safe. But I can't tell what he wants. He won't talk to me. He hardly even comes home. He works all day, all night. Barely eats, barely speaks to me. It's like something's eating him away from inside. He's just not the same. He's not. Facing death, it changes a person. It has to, don't you think? I guess you've noticed a change in Walt."
Gus,Please.
Walt,What is this?
Gus,Your new lab.
Walt,"My God. Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed. Look at the size of this reaction vessel. Oh, it's gotta be 1200 liters. Where? Where? How did you know how to put this all together?"
Gus,"I had excellent help, as will you. Quite a lot of planning went into this."
Walt,I would say so.
Gus,"The laundry upstairs, I've owned it for years. It receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis, detergents and such. There is nothing suspicious about it and my employees, to be sure, are well-trained, trustworthy. The filtration system is state of the art. It will vent nothing but clean, odorless steam just as the laundry does and through the very same stacks. I need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable. You would choose your own hours, of course come and go as you please so long as the quota is met."
Walt,Sorry. The answer is still no. I have made a series of very bad decisions and I cannot make another one.
Gus,Why did you make these decisions?
Walt,For the good of my family.
Gus,"Then they weren't bad decisions. What does a man do, Walter? A man provides for his family."
Walt,This cost me my family.
Gus,"When you have children, you always have family. They will always be your priority, your responsibility. And a man, a man provides. And he does it even when he's not appreciated or respected or even loved. He simply bears up, and he does it because he's a man."
Ted,Any chance we could grab a quick bite? The Thai place around the corner's pretty good.
Skyler,I really gotta head home.
Ted,"All right, rain check, then."
Walter Junior,"Great dinner, Mom. Can I be excused?"
Skyler,To do homework or to play video games?
Walter Junior,I can multitask.
Skyler,Yeah. You wanna take her?
Walt,Yeah.
Hank,"Give me something, Andy. Come on. Welded onto the back of a house. Well, that's classy. Christ. Okay. Okay, thanks. Hey, Janice. Janice. That the last one?"
Janice,"Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had. Twenty nine early '80s Bounders registered in New Mexico."
Hank,Could you check again?
Janice,Now? Can I do it after the party?
Hank,"Janice, I'm dead in the water here."
Janice,"Okay, I'll check."
Hank,"Hey, how are you guys doing?"
Steve,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it really good, I tell you. All good."
Hank,"Gomey. Yeah. Time for the little bird to fly the nest, huh? The right guy for the job since the bean-speak comes natural and all."
Steve,"Wanna know how to say ""get bent"" in Spanish?"
Hank,"Just don't go native on me, all right? Hey. Here. Know your enemy and all. Fight the good fight, brother."
Steve,I will. Who got a drink around here?
Janice,"Your hunch was right. One more RV. DMV said the registration wasn't renewed but then they realized it was never filed as non-operational or destroyed. No police report, either."
Skyler,"I just don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore, you know? It's like I'm paralyzed like if I take a step in any direction I'm gonna make a spectacular mistake. God, I could go for a glass of wine about now. You wanna go to? Sorry, never mind. Anyway breaking news is I am sleeping with my boss and I don't know why. Yep. That's a lie. I do know why. I mean, he's a lovely guy. He's a really good person but, I mean, it's not like we're ever gonna…Somehow, and I can't actually believe it but my entire family sees me as some sort of…My own sister, my brother-in-law. My teenage son tells me I'm a bitch. And you say tell him the truth. Tell him about his father but I can't. Ever. How could I? And this man that I'm seeing, you know as wrong as I know it is as much as I know I'm probably doing it to make Walt leave me it is the only thing in my day where I don't feel like I'm drowning."
Lawyer,So he knows about this other man?
Skyler,Yeah.
Lawyer,So then he'll sign?
Skyler,Walt says he's not going anywhere so that's a really brilliant gambit on my part. Yep. Genius. He keeps money in the house.
Lawyer,"Your husband, the drug dealer? How much money?"
Skyler,"I didn't count it. It's heavy. A bag, where he keeps it."
Lawyer,Are you asking my permission to spend this money?
Skyler,"No. God, no. I just, no, I'm just, you know I'm just trying to just talk it through."
Lawyer,Let me just say that I'm half as qualified and twice the price of a therapist. There is nothing to discuss here.
Skyler,"I'm just saying, you know? We have a history. He's the father of my children and maybe what he did…"
Lawyer,"He did it for the family. Right? Well, guess what. That is one enormous load of horse shit. Okay. I'm going to spell this out as simply as I can for you. You are a fool to stay in that house one minute longer. If your husband won't leave, then you go. You are now an accessory after the fact. You are culpable. You, your children, you could lose everything you own. Do you understand? All courtesy of this criminal you refuse to divorce."
Skyler,I didn't marry a criminal.
Lawyer,"Well, you're married to one now."
Saul,"How's about we run through this one more time especially where I do the talking, you don't say jack?"
Jesse,"Oh, I'm gonna say jack. I'm gonna say plenty."
Saul,"What did we say about escalating, huh? Who's got your back here? Me, all right? I'm going to take care of things. Hey, what are the parameters of this sobriety thing you got going?"
Jesse,What do you mean?
Saul,"Can you take a Xanax? Because I got a drawer full of them. I get them from my ""chiropractor."" Vietnamese, 5-foot tall. She adjusts you to ""completion."" Her name's Kim Nu Suong. As delicious as it sounds. I should give you her card."
Jesse,Hell with this. I'm out of here.
Francesca,He's here.
Saul,"Send him in. Hello, Walt. Good to see you. Please, have a seat here. Mr. Pinkman, if you will."
Jesse,You're late.
Saul,"Gentlemen, if we could come to some accommodation here now. There's always a way to oil everyone's lock. This young man is prepared to offer you a sweetheart of a deal for doing precisely nothing."
Walt,Really?
Saul,Ten percent of all future profits from his solo venture. That's money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox. Consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contribution to the business thus far. I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.
Jesse,"That's charity, is what that is. I do all the work. He sits around on his fat ass judging people."
Saul,"Escalating. Stop. So there's that, but then there's one small detail. Clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate when he paid you half of Jesse's earnings. He must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways."
Walt,Take it. It belongs to you.
Jesse,You're damn right it belongs to me.
Saul,I knew I could count on you boys to play nice. That almost brings a tear to my eye.
Walt,Enjoy it. Spend it in good health. That is the last money you'll ever earn in this business.
Jesse,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Walt,"Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse, but our mutual associate was only using you to get to me."
Jesse,What are you talking about?
Walt,"See, he needs someone with expertise. Someone who knows what he's doing. In other words, he needs me."
Jesse,You're telling me you're cooking again?
Walt,"Yeah. Let's see, how should I put this? I'm in. You're out."
Saul,"Walt, hold on there. What was the offer, if I may ask?"
Walt,It's three million for three months of my time.
Saul,"You're gonna need that money laundered. I mean, of course. What was our deal before? Seventeen percent. That's a shade high. Let's settle on an even 15. That's a nice round number."
Walt,Five percent.
Saul,Fourteen's fair.
Walt,Five.
Saul,Thirteen.
Walt,Five.
Saul,"Twelve. For old times' sake, 12."
Walt,Five.
Saul,"I'm a reasonable guy. It's a short-term deal. Ten even, but I can't go any lower and still respect myself. Five."
Jesse,"What in the hell just happened? You're my lawyer, not his!"
Saul,"That's the way of the world, kid. Go with the winner."
Jesse,You think this will stop me from cooking?
Walt,Cook whatever you like. As long as it's that ridiculous Chili P or some other dreck but don't even think about using my formula.
Jesse,"Just try and stop me, bitch."
Mrs. Ortega,Yes?
Hank,"Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?"
Mrs. Ortega,Yes.
Hank,"Hi, I'm Hank Schrader. I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration. We're interested in an RV that's registered to your name and address. Do you have an RV?"
Mrs. Ortega,I did. It was stolen months ago.
Hank,"Stolen, huh? Yeah. Well, then I'm curious as to why the theft was never reported. I'm not seeing any records of it with the police or the DMV."
Mrs. Ortega,I just didn't get around to it.
Hank,"May I ask why? I mean, it's a great way to get the family together for an affordable vacation. It must've been a blow when it went missing."
Mrs. Ortega,It was.
Hank,Do you have any ideas at all who might've taken it?
Mrs. Ortega,"I didn't want him arrested. He ran with a bad crowd, but he was never a bad person. I thought he could turn his life around."
Hank,"Who are we talking about, Mrs. Ortega?"
Mrs. Ortega,My son.
Hank,I'd really like to speak with him.
Mrs. Ortega,He's passed away. He was sh*t two months ago.
Hank,What was your son's name?
Mrs. Ortega,Christian.
Hank,Christian Ortega. Was his nickname Combo?
Hank,Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.
"And all the while, I kept thinking about that great old Whitman poem","""When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."""
My advice,That's probably not a good strategy.
Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact,Shred your mama's head like a cabbage.
"And the whole time, all I could think about was","""Why today? Why? Why can't I just spend a few extra minutes in the car with my family?"" I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life."
"Time of death, 20",43.
Because I got three little letters for you,IRS.
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade he looked at it and said,"""Is that the best you can do?"" At first I thought to myself, ""Hell yeah, bitch. Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys."" I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but It was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked. He was just asking me honestly, ""Is that all you got?"" And for some reason, I thought to myself  ""Yeah, man, I can do better,"" so I started from scratch. I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box number five I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane. I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood. It was fitted with pegs, no screws."
"You know, ""Scrabble, just knock it off",""" She got like that toward the end."
Then he said,"""Never give up on family."
So which means pick me up about 8,30? - I'll be here with bells on.
"And when the police come, I'm supposed to say","""I never thought about it, officers."
"Anyway, my partner and I'd get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say","""Come on, tonight's the night we press charges."
What's it look like? Looks like you're looking at a rock at2,24 in the morning.
"What's happening? The time? Time of death, 20",43.
I'm gonna make sure I get this down to UPS before 5,00.
I'll have it for you sometime between midnight and 2,00 A.
"Bottom line, I have done this long enough to know that there are two kinds of heists",Those where the guys get away with it and those that leave witnesses.
I think first pitch is at 10,"00 AM, so, uh - 10 00."
"Well, you have that 3",00.
